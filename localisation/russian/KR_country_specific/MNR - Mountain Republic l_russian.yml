 MNR_sultan_klych_girey_high_command_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMarch 15th, 1880, in Ulyap, Kuban Oblast, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LSultan Klych-Girey (in Russian Army - Kelech Shakhanovich Sultan-Girey) comes from a dynasty of Girey Khans of Crimea, and thus is a descendant of the Genghis Khan. By his time the family was living in Maykop in North Caucasus as typical Russian military aristocracy. Klych-Girey graduated from the Yelisavetgrad Cavalry Cadet School in 1901, and would serve most of his career in the infamous Caucasian Native Cavalry Division. In the division, he would become close to General Kornilov, then-commander of the division, and would join the Volunteer Army soon after its creation. General-Major Klych-Girey was tasked with recruitment efforts in the North Caucasus, aided by his extensive connections in Circassia.\n\nAfter the civil war, he continued to serve in the Russian Army, and was initially supportive towards creation of the North Caucasus Special Autonomous Region. Constant unrest and military conflict in the region did eventually put him at odds with General Kornilov's handling of the region, and eventually in 1929 Klych-Girey was retired from the military. After the rise of Savinkov and heightening tensions in the Caucasus, he became a part of the North Caucasian emigré community in Germany, trying to find ways for the Caucasians to oppose Moscow's attempts at abolishing any sembalance of autonomy that was left.§!" #NT!
