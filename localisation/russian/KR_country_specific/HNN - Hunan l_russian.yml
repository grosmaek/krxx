 HNN_totalist_party: "СПК-(Р)"
 HNN_totalist_party_long: "Синдикалистская партия Китая - Радикалы\n§gКак и его сестры в остальных частях Китая, хунаньское отделение СПК содержит внутри себя молодую, энергичную, а главное, политически радикальную фракцию. Номинально объединившись вокруг неустрашимого и неутомимого Жэнь Биши, который часто курсирует между Хунанем и Шанхаем, радикальная фракция выступает за более активный и жесткий подход к роли КСП в китайской политике.\n\n Благодаря влиянию Жэнь Биши, уделяющего особое внимание молодежному движению, его материалистический социалистический радикализм надеется на светлое будущее Китая, свободного от тиранической хватки капитализма. Ревностные по своей природе, они оказывают воинственное сопротивление Чжао и Чжили, даже иногда сражаются с ортодоксальной фракцией Цай Хэсэна.§!"
 HNN_syndicalist_party: "СПК-(О)"
 HNN_syndicalist_party_long: "Синдикалистская партия Китая - Ортодоксы\n§gОртодоксальная фракция Синдикалистской партии Китая - доминирующая сила в подпольном рабочем движении Хунани, которая имеет большой вес в Чанше и Чандэ. Хунаньское отделение СПК ведет свою родословную от лидеров Лиги китайских синдикалистов и действует в основном под руководством Цай Хэсэна. Поддерживая ряд подпольных контактов с основным отделением партии и рабочими движениями во всех регионах Китая, они считают себя последним бастионом для рабочих Хунани.\n\nПолучив реальную отдачу после возвращения Цай Хэсэна в страну в 1932 году, СПК функционирует в основном как препятствие для антипрофсоюзной и антирабочей позиции Чжао. Оставаясь в стороне от межфракционной борьбы СПК между Ли Лисанем и Цай Хэсэном, и даже от борьбы Объединенного фронта Гоминьдан-СПК, хунаньское отделение сосредоточилось исключительно на провинциальных делах.§!"
 HNN_radical_socialist_party: "8-я армия (Радикалы)"
 HNN_radical_socialist_party_long: "8-я армия Гоминьдана (Радикалы)\n§gЕсли один человек и символизирует всех радикалов 8-й армии, так это ее командующий и неофициальный лидер Хэ Лун. Многие ветераны, входившие в состав его дивизий в Хунаньской, Сычуаньской и других армиях, следуют за командующим с непоколебимой преданностью. В июле 1926 года он возглавил Национально-революционную армию, став командиром 6-й дивизии 8-й армии и посланником гарнизона Западной Хунани.\n\nНа протяжении всего похода дивизия Хэ вела бои, став главной боевой силой, способствуя быстрому падению Ханьяна. Однако Хэ не мог отвлечь свое внимание на все сразу, и Северный поход вскоре рухнул под немецким сапогом. Следуя за своим начальником Таном Шэнчжи на протяжении всей войны, Хэ оказался в зоне повстанцев Миньганя, где познакомился с Пэн Дэхуаем. Эти два человека, имеющие схожее происхождение и сильные социалистические взгляды, начинают формировать силовой блок в 8-й армии, объединяясь в "Радикалов". Будучи членами Временного комитета действий, Хэ и Пэн последовательно продвигают линию аграрного социализма, надеясь обратить своего начальника Тан Шэнчжи все ближе и ближе к своим идеалам.§!"
 HNN_social_democrat_party: "8-я армия"
 HNN_social_democrat_party_long: "8-я армия Гоминьдана\n§g8-я армия Национально-революционной армии, корни которой уходят в 4-ю дивизию Хунаньской армии под командованием Тан Шэнчжи и бригаду Е Ци из Новой клики Гуанси, представляет собой своеобразный гибрид. В ее ряды входили Хэ Цзянь, Ли Пинсянь, Лю Син, Е Ци и, наконец, Хэ Лун. В июле 1926 года они с упорством вступили в бой с Северным походом и одержали множество громких побед, таких как взятие Ханьяна.\n\nНо все было напрасно, так как клика Чжили призвала на помощь своих немецких благодетелей, которые прибыли, чтобы раздавить силы, защищающие Гуандун, под своими сапогами. Продолжая сопротивление на всех фронтах, 8-я доблестно сражалась в битве при Цзиньхуа, помогая 4-й армии. Их усилия привели к крупному поражению, и 8-я армия могла лишь в ужасе смотреть, как 4-я армия распадается на глазах, рассеиваясь по Гуандуну и Миниганю. Отчаянно отступая, 8-я армия оказалась в ловушке в Восточной Хунани. Возможно, в качестве мелкой мести Тан Шэнчжи пришлось снова сражаться с войсками Е Кайсина, в итоге он потерял большую часть 8-й армии и отступил в Миньгань, чтобы присоединиться к восстанию.\n\nВо время революционной борьбы в Миньгане 8-я армия просто радикализировалась в отсутствие какого-либо надзорного органа, развивая свои собственные фракции внутри армии. Ядро приверженцев Тан Шэнчжи, среди которых были Лю Син и Ли Пинсянь, твердо придерживалось его эклектичного социализма аграрного типа. В отличие от 8-й армии радикалы под эгидой командиров Хэ Луна и Пэн Дэхуая придерживались более радикальной линии социализма, близкой к идеологии Временного комитета действий.§!"
 HNN_social_liberal_party: "Республиканцы"
 HNN_social_liberal_party_long: "Независимые республиканцы\n§gСплотившись вокруг уроженца Хунани интеллектуала Чжоу Шичжао, широкая группа депутатов собрания, известная как "Независимые республиканцы", представляет собой фигуры, не входящие ни в Народное общество обновления Чжао, ни в Китайскую ассоциацию национально-демократического строительства, ни даже в Конституционно-демократическую партию. Подобно фракциям независимых республиканцев в законодательных органах Пекина и Фэнтяня, эти начинающие политики образуют свой собственный политический блок на политической сцене Хунаня и активно лоббируются Народным обществом обновления и КАНДС.\n\nВ отличие от своих собратьев в законодательных органах Пекина и Фэнтяня, независимые республиканцы Хунаня могут выражать реальную политическую силу и мнения через Собрание Хунаня, сияющую звезду китайской демократии. Пока что они не могут превзойти Народное общество обновления Чжао по количеству голосов, но, возможно, в будущем сияющая провинциальная демократия Хунаня позволит партиям всех мастей и цветов сформироваться из клики "Независимых республиканцев". Однако до этого дня они остаются широкой политической фракцией, ограниченной своими независимыми кампаниями.§!"
 HNN_market_liberal_party: "КАНДС"
 HNN_market_liberal_party_long: "Китайская ассоциация национально-демократического строительства\n§gУникальный случай для политических партий Хунани, КАНДС под руководством Хуан Яньпэя не может проследить свои корни в Хунани, а скорее в Цзянсу. Изначально партия была создана как "Китайское общество профессионального образования" Хуаном в Шанхае после того, как он провел время, наблюдая за различными системами образования по всему миру. Организованное в Шанхае, оно первоначально сосредоточилось на расширении образования в пределах города, подчеркивая необходимость обучения практическим навыкам, полезным для получения работы. Участвуя в движении 30 мая 1925 года, движение стало одной из главных демократических сил в Шанхае.\n\nПочти не пострадало от Северного похода, несмотря на захват Шанхая Гоминьданом и Чжили. Хуан продолжал свою работу до 1932 года, когда в Шанхае произошло крупномасштабное восстание, поддержанное в основном СПК и Гоминьданом. Репрессии за восстание были быстрыми и широкими, маршал Сунь использовал его как казус белли против интеллектуалов и демократов в своих основных пяти провинциях. В результате этих репрессий Хуан и Китайское общество профессионального образования бежали из Шанхая, и Чжао встретил их с распростертыми объятиями. С тех пор они реформировались под названием "Китайская ассоциация национально-демократического строительства" и стали полноценной политической партией в Хунане. Имея схожие с Чжао демократические цели, КАНДС выступает в качестве либеральной оппозиции ему и в большей степени поддерживает рабочих и профсоюзы. Однако если дело дойдет до драки, они будут рады сотрудничать с НОО в защите демократии в Хунане.§!"
 HNN_social_conservative_party: "НОО"
 HNN_social_conservative_party_long: "Народное общество обновления\n§gНародное общество обновления - крупнейший политический блок в Хунани - ведет свою историю с 1922 года и первых провинциальных выборов в Хунани. Сформировавшись вокруг Чжао Хенти на выборах 1922 года, НОО выступает в качестве его политической партии, поддерживая его на протяжении всего первого срока, восстания Тан Шэнчжи и его восстановления с подачи У Пейфу. Будучи полностью уверенной в том, что Чжао восстановит конституцию, как только сможет, НОО поддерживала его на протяжении всего времени, поддерживая его усилия по расширению образования, сокращению военного бюджета в пользу общественных работ и в целом по созданию более демократической системы.\n\nПравое крыло партии, в основном, поддерживается дворянством и элитой Хунани, что подталкивает ее к более консервативному направлению. Это направление вызывает проблемы, когда речь идет о рабочих активистах и профсоюзных работниках. Другая основная база поддержки - интеллигенция Хунани, которая смотрит на Чжао в благоприятном свете благодаря его усилиям по созданию демократической системы Хунани и в целом формирует левое крыло НОО. Народное общество обновления твердо стоит на ногах в качестве ведущего политического блока в Хунани, а также как верные подчиненные Чжао Хэнти, который пользуется поддержкой обоих крыльев партии.§!"
 HNN_authoritarian_democrat_party: "6-я армия"
 HNN_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "6-я армия Гоминьдана\n§gСвое начало 6-я армия Национально-революционной армии берет в январе 1926 года, она была сформирована на основе первоначально основанной армии Хунань, и обе они сохранили своего первоначального командующего Чэн Цяня. Вступив в Северный поход 6 июля 1926 года, Шестая армия приняла участие в ограниченных боевых действиях, в основном направленных на очистку территории после молниеносных наступлений 8-й, 4-й и 7-й армий. Однако, когда Северный фронт распался, 6-я армия оказалась в западной части Хунани вместе со 2-й армией в центре и 8-й армией на востоке. Когда остатки 1-й, 3-й и 7-й армий отступили в Гуйчжоу, 6-я, почти не пострадавшая, сопровождала их в изгнании.\n\n Проживая в Гуйчжоу и даже будучи использованной Тан Цзяо в качестве разменной монеты, 6-я армия считает себя "аполитичной" в сфере гоминьдановских изгнанников. Поддерживая связи с Сунь Фо и его Фракцией реконструкции, а также с Временным комитетом действий, 6-й армии удается действовать как связующее звено между левым Центральным комитетом и правыми фракциями, такими как Хэ Инцинь и Чжу Пейдэ.\n\nНесмотря на то, что на поверхности все верно, 6-я армия оказывается вместилищем старых революционеров времен Тонгменхуэй. Правда, тех, кто был связан с Гоминьданом, но все же тех, кто сопротивлялся реорганизации в частном порядке. Найдя друзей среди Клики Западных Холмов и других центристских фракций Гоминьдана, 6-я армия желает скорейшей опеки и будет бороться за то, чтобы она состоялась.§!"
 HNN_paternal_autocrat_party: "Юэянский гарнизон"
 HNN_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Юэянский гарнизон\n§gГарнизон Юэяна, первоначально перешедший в подчинение У Пэйфу в результате переговоров между ним и Чжао, просуществовал почти столько же, сколько Чжао был губернатором Хунани. Расположенный на важной границе между Хунанем и Хубэем, Юэян служил прямым связующим звеном между Хунанем и кликой Чжили. Этот факт стал более очевидным после восстания Тан Шэнчжи и последующего Северного похода. Считая необходимым усилить гарнизон и опасаясь вступления Чжао в Лигу Суня, У назначил туда в 1927 году генерал-адмирала Тан Сянмина. За последнее десятилетие Тан верно служил командующему гарнизоном, установив строгий режим и абсолютную преданность. Адмирал Тан заслужил уважение и преданность гарнизона Юэяна, и на него можно положиться в любой ад и паводок.§!"
 HNN_national_populist_party: "Старая клика Гуйчжоу"
 HNN_national_populist_party_long: "Старая клика Гуйчжоу\n§gСтарая клика Гуйчжоу ведет свою историю от Тан Цзяо, который возглавил провинцию Гуйчжоу в 1912 году. Однако его губернаторство продлилось недолго: когда Цай Е потерял власть, он вернулся в Юньнань, чтобы занять его место, и назначил Лю Сяньши военным губернатором. Несмотря на потерю власти, ему удавалось удерживать контроль над своей кликой до 1920 года, когда его племянник Ван Вэньхуа устроил переворот, названный инцидентом Минцзю, в результате которого погибло несколько видных деятелей при Лю. Жестокость Вана привела к тому, что он так и не смог взять всю власть в Гуйчжоу, и был убит Юанем Цзумином в 1921 году.\n\nЭто закрепило за Юанем позицию лидера клики. Несмотря на то, что с тех пор Юань дважды был отстранен от власти, один раз Тан Цзяо и Лю Сяньши, а второй раз Лю Сяном и Ян Сеном, он твердо стоял во главе своей клики, а после предательства Гоминьдана в конце Северного похода, по совету своего подчиненного Чжао Юсуна, Юань был назначен Пекином губернатором, но контролировал лишь небольшую часть Гуйчжоу, остальная часть была занята Тан Цзяо. С 1927 года клика Старого Гуйчжоу радикализировалась в антигоминьдановском и антикоммунистическом направлении, а Чжао Юсун стал лидером младокитайцев в Гуйчжоу, и эта партия фактически сформировала гражданское крыло Старой клики Гуйчжоу, поддерживая Юаня как "аполитичного сильного человека".§!"

Состоящая из северян, в основном из родной провинции Тан Сянмина - Хубэя, она предпочитает держаться на расстоянии от Лиги и Южного Чжили, отдавая предпочтение Северному Чжили в Пекине и Чунцине. Хотя внутренние чжилийцы, особенно У Пэйфу, часто могут казаться... безразличными к губернатору, те, кто непосредственно подчиняется ему, признают его мастерство в бою и на посту губернатора.

 HNN_CERA: "КПК"
 HNN_CERA_long: "Конституционная партия Китая\n§gКонституционная партия Китая, возглавляемая Тан Хуалуном, берет свое начало от Прогрессивной партии и кружка Лян Цичао, в который входил Тан. Изначально служа при Юань Шикае, фракция Тана изо всех сил старалась извлечь лучшее из плохой ситуации, пытаясь смягчить и умерить его режим. Однако после того как Юань провозгласил себя императором, Тан разочаровался в нем, а позже посоветовал ему отречься от престола и уйти из политики. После смерти Юань Шикая и прихода к власти Дуань Цижуя политическая мощь Тан Хуалуна быстро уменьшилась, и он решил путешествовать по миру в течение следующих нескольких лет.\n\nТан Хуалун вернулся в Китай в 1927 году, когда его союзник Лян Цичао стал председателем АРНКИ. Он недолго работал в Пекине, пока его брат, Тан Сянмин, не пригласил его в Юэян с молчаливыми обещаниями занять пост мэра. После краткого обсуждения этого вопроса с Ляном он согласился и переехал в приграничный город. После уверенной победы на выборах мэра Юэяна он использовал свои старые связи для создания политического блока в городе и его окрестностях, значительно расширив хунаньское отделение КПК, которую он теперь возглавляет. После того как его брат стал губернатором Хунани, он и его "юэянская группа", как их неофициально называют, пытаются оказывать умеренное влияние на режим Тан Сянмина, поддерживая его и влияя на него в более умеренном направлении. По крайней мере, именно на это они надеются, поддерживая нового губернатора.§!"

Состоящая в основном из представителей дворянства, Ассоциация Гармонии отличается консерватизмом, хотя на нее, безусловно, влияют Тан Хуалун и его Партия китайских конституционалистов, неофициально называемая "группой Юэяна", поскольку пограничный город является центром их власти. Абсолютно преданная своему губернатору, Ассоциация Гармонии служит его гражданской рукой, способной протянуть как открытую руку, так и сжатый кулак любому противнику губернатора Тана на политической арене.§!"
 HNN_kuomintang_second_army: "2-я армия"
 HNN_kuomintang_second_army_long: "2-я армия Гоминьдана\n§gВозникшая из войск военачальника Тан Янкай, первоначальная 2-я армия может быть датирована осенью 1923 года, когда доктор Сунь Ятсен поддержал Тан Янкая в качестве главнокомандующего Хунаньской армии Цзянго. Будучи силой умеренного мышления в революционном зейтгейсте Гоминьдана, первоначальные члены 2-й армии вняли призыву доктора Суня к оружию и перешли на сторону его правительства в Гуанчжоу, якобы объединившись для борьбы с вторжением армий Бэйяна.\n\nПосле реорганизации Национально-революционной армии Тан Янкай сначала сохранил свои независимые провинциальные силы, но после восстаний Цзяньго Юньнаньской армии и Цзяньго Гуйской армии генералиссимус Чан Кайши реорганизовал армию во 2-ю армию НРА в 1925 году. Под руководством командующего Тан Янкай и заместителя командующего армией Лу Дипина. Под ее юрисдикцией находились 4-я, 5-я и 6-я дивизии под командованием Чжан Хуэйцаня, Тан Даоюаня и Дай Юэ соответственно. Доблестно сражаясь в Северном походе, армия была окружена в Хунани, но Чжао протянул руку милосердия своему старому начальнику Тан Янкаю, предложив амнистию, если они сдадутся.\n\nПосле прихода к власти Гоминьдана в Хунани Тан Янкай посчитал нужным возобновить деятельность своей 2-й армии. Не обладая реальной военной силой, 2-я армия представляет собой канал, через который старые умеренные хунаньцы могут выразить свое мнение. Позиционируя себя в качестве посредника и точки соприкосновения между 6-й и 8-й армиями, 2-я армия оказалась в весьма затруднительном положении, получив незавидную задачу поддерживать порядок в Хунане.§!"

Хэ Цзянь. После коварных междоусобиц, бушевавших в Гоминьдане с момента победы на выборах, Хэ Цзянь практически подлил масла в огонь, открыто перейдя со своей 2-й дивизией 8-й армии на сторону 6-й армии Чэн Цяня. Получив повышение и две новые должности в правительстве провинции Хунань, амбициозный генерал принялся за реформирование родной Хунани всеми возможными способами.\n\nИспользуя свои двойные титулы для обеспечения мира и стабильности в Хунани, генерал якобы занимается решением проблемы хунаньского регионального ополчения. Однако он использует свои личные силы и людей под своим командованием для гораздо более широких целей, чем его первоначальное предназначение. Заботясь о том, чтобы новая эра в Хунани под властью Гоминьдана была как можно более процветающей, управление занимается продвижением реформ Хэ Цзяня как по официальным, так и по неофициальным каналам, лоббируя и поддерживая инициативы Чэн Цяня и Тан Шэнчжи.\n\nПожалуй, считаясь еще одной пешкой в шахматном матче между 6-й и 8-й партиями, люди из близкого окружения Хэ Цзяня слишком хорошо осведомлены о завышенных амбициях генералов, а некоторые считают, что "король" Хунани может сам нацелиться на пост председателя. Тем не менее, Управление по умиротворению сельских районов и сохранению мира по-прежнему стремится к справедливому, беспристрастному и стабильному управлению. Если только вы не социалист...§!"

 HNN_zhao_hengti: "Zhao Hengti"
 HNN_zhao_hengti_bio: "Zhao Hengti, the governor of Hunan for well over a decade. Born in 1880 in Hengyang, Zhao Hengti attended the 6th Chinese Class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, graduating with a specialisation in the field of artillery. He joined the Tongmenghui under Sun Yat-sen and participated in both the Xinhai Revolution and the Second Revolution as a military commander. After the failure of the Second Revolution, Zhao was imprisoned by Tang Xiangming on behalf of Yuan Shikai. He was released two years later by Cai E, and was given command of Hunan's first division. In 1920 he and Tan Yankai expelled Zhang Jingyao as Governor, Tan becoming Governor and Zhao Army Director-General.\n\nWith the Pingjiang Mutiny Tan resigned as Governor in favour of Zhao, and introduced the first provincial constitutional movement in Asia, formulating the Hunan Provincial Constitution, establishing a democratic provincial council and gubernatorial elections, of which he won the ones held in 1922. As Governor of Hunan, Zhao limited his power as the governor, a move commended by many.\n\nWith the onset of the Northern Expedition, Zhao was pushed out of Hunan by his former subordinate, Tang Shengzhi.

In October 1913 Tan Yankai was forced to resign as Governor of Hunan, and Tang was appointed by Yuan Shikai as Governor, and supported Yuan's attempts at crowning himself Emperor while ruling Hunan with an iron fist and a strict regime, earning him the nickname \"Tang the Butcher\". Due to his support of Yuan Shikai, Tang had to flee Hunan in July of 1916 as the Province sided with the National Protection Alliance, being replaced by Tan Yankai.\n\nHe joined the Zhili clique in 1917, and during the second Zhili-Fengtian war he served in Military Law Enforcement. When the Northern Expedition was defeated, Tang was given a garrison in Yueyang. While Wu would officially support Zhao as Governor of Hunan, he made sure to keep Tang ready just in case the Government in Changsha decided to turn against Beijing. Tang has notable sway with the western warlords, Chen Quzhen and Tian Yingzhao, and the Zhili appointed Governor of Guizhou, Yuan Zuming.

In 1909, Xingyi military school director Wang Wenhua recommended Yuan to Guizhou military envoy Liu Xianshi to assist in training the town regiment in Xingyi. When the National Protection War began, Yuan would join the National Protection Army under Wang Wenhua's command.\n\nAfter Wang ousted Liu Xianshi and seized power in Guizhou, Yuan would plot his demise. Yuan assassinated Wang in 1921, realigning the province with Beijing, becoming governor the following year. This infuriated Yunnan Governor Tang Jiyao, who would assist Liu Xianshi in pushing Yuan into Sichuan. Yuan intervened in local conflicts, ultimately resulting in Yang Sen and Liu Xiang jointly pushing Yuan out. With his army in tatters, Yuan aligned with the KMT, and his army became the 12th Army of the NRA.\n\nYuan assisted Tang Shengzhi in an invasion of Hunan, but the Northern Expedition would soon turn into a disaster, as the German Empire intervened on the side of the Zhili Clique and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was killed in chaos. Negotiating with Wu Peifu via his subordinate Zhao Yusong, Yuan would realign with Beijing.

In 1932, Mao Zedong would lead and participate in the Autumn Harvest Uprising, which was in solidarity with the Shanghai Uprising, but was killed when provincial forces under Zhao Hengti and aided by Tang Xiangming put down the insurrection. Zhou would become deeply resentful towards both Zhao and Tang for causing Mao's death, and while nominally aligned with Huang's CNDCA, opposes continued Zhili presence in the province as well as Zhao's governorship.§!"

Whilst we dare not disturb the delicate balance of Hunan's agricultural system too much, by recalibrating our land tax alongside our misc taxes and duties, we shall effectively target the wealth of the gentry and other landowners.

 HNN_maintain_order_in_countryside_desc: "Our rural society is currently undergoing seismic events in the broader cultural perception of what it means to be a peasant, and a landlord. To dissuade any attempts of the peasantry organising against the government or its bureaucrats, the only just response is to at least attempt to equalise the system. By demanding implementing regular audits of estates, and instating forced budgeting for the gentry, that should travel a far distance in tipping the scales towards the peasants. Likewise, to prevent any dissemination of anti-government sentiment and rhetoric, dispatching additional police officers to the countryside will aid in the maintenance of security, and generate the gratitude of the gentry."

With the absolute loyalty of a new generation of district officials, we shall undergo a limited policy of redistributing the patchwork lands under our control.

Refusing to see reason, and only respecting force, it is time that the government has a greater role in their daily lives. By dispatching army units to villages, we shall the gentry that the government means business. And if they continue to disrupt our efforts, they will lose the rights to their lands too."

No more. With the Kuomintang finally in charge, we will stand fully with the common people, and mobilise them to strike back against their tyrannical overlords. Whilst we must show some restraint, lest anarchy rule the day, arming the peasantry and training local militia to protect their interests will show the elites that Hunan's peasantry has had enough, and the government has heard their cries."

For there is a peaceful method that still remains most damaging to the interests and revenues of the gentry.

Their injustices and resistance only continue to frustrate both KMT Radical ideologues and the peasantry alike. Within the various local roles of governance, the gentry have lined the officials pockets, transforming what would be honest bureaucrats working for the government into tools for continued exploitation. However with Kuomintang control established, we shall relieve all those with elite sympathies within the district governments, and dispatch our own cadres to fill their places."
 HNN_reducing_gentry_control_desc_nokmt: "Even with our continued efforts to hammer away at the heart of the peasantry's troubles, the gentry continue to be aloof, clinging desperately onto whatever wealth or political power they can muster. Their continued persistence into clinging onto the old ways has led to much grief within the government, and with numerous elites actually participating within the provincial assembly, a block of political opposition to our continued reforms. Refusing to see reason, the Governor has decided that radical action is necessary. By reshuffling local district magistrates with fresh cadres from Changsha, those committed to the ideals of Federalism shall rule even at the smallest level of governance.

Once a close ally of the gentry, working together with them to ensure a stable Hunan province, their continued attempts to cling to tradition and the past has been their downfall. With no other option left, and heavy regret, the Governor has authorised the forceful seizure, nationalisation, and redistribution of all gentry estates deemed to be violating the principles of the agricultural reform programme. Extreme in intent, it is hoped that this shall be the final step to freeing Hunan's peasantry from their shackles of torment."
 HNN_seizing_estates_desc_kmt: "The continued insolence of the landlords has come at continued great costs to the progress and advancement of the province, and the nation as a whole. How is Hunan supposed to aid in the conclusion of the National Revolution if it is too indecisive, too cautious, to deal with the issues at home? Authorised by all members of the Hunan Provincial Government, various soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army will see to the seizure of elite estates and landholdings, to be redistributed in a \"Land to the Tiller\" programme. With this, the gentry issue shall be ultimately handled, and Hunan can look ever so fondly to a bright future ahead."

When the harvest is poor however, these financial woes are compounded and result in a brutal cycle of chronic debt. In order to support our toilers, let us negotiate with the banks to offer loans at favourable rates. Furthermore, we shall work to provide crop insurance directly to the interested farmers, granting them a sense of financial security in such dire times."

However to our West lies the lands of Guizhou province. Whilst relatively prosperous on its own, the mismanagement of the province by the respective parties of Yuan Zuming and Tang Jiyu has lead to a serious unevenness in agricultural harvests. Through the construction of irrigation canals directed from the Xiang river, we can establish new reservoirs to ensure that no harvest is truly a failure."

Whilst previous decades within Hunan saw most established telegraphs being related exclusively to military affairs. With our new lease on development, let us work towards expanding our network to not only our districts, but in such a way as to achieve broader integration into the national network as whole. With such efforts, only then shall Hunan truly be a modern province."

Disconnected in nature, and often remaining isolated within provincial borders, it is a situation most dire, yet one that will have to wait until national unification. Due to Hunan's greater integration with the internal trade routes of the nation, Changsha has the rare benefit of containing a direct line from Beijing to Guangzhou. Yet such a grand railroad reflects poorly on the fact that even within our own province, one of our larger cities remains disconnected from the capital. Through the use of state funding, we shall enlist the assistance of local railroad companies to finally connect Kaili to the rest of the nation."

 HNN_securing_urban_support: "Securing Urbanite Support"
 HNN_securing_urban_support_desc: "For quite some time, the Urban centres of Hunan have been hotbeds for the development and growth of the Chinese Syndicalist Party; fomenting divisions between the administration and the workers. It has created a large divide, effectively culling any attempts to hear their qualms, and for the government to likewise preach our reassurances. Whilst no doubt incredibly costly, it is without a doubt necessary that we bring the workers and government together once more, for progress has no time for petty squabbles."
  
 HNN_economic_controls_board: "Establish an Economic Controls Board"
 HNN_economic_controls_board_desc: "Decried by the defenders of capitalism within our province as authoritarianism on the government's part, the drafted plans for the establishment of the Economic Controls Board of Hunan Province would see the the governing body control the ebb and flow of imports via licensing. With great care, the board would exclude unwanted foreign commodities that would have an unfair advantage with Hunan's own domestic production. However, the controversial aspect of the plan situates in the fact that the licensing applies not only to products outside China, but to those outside the provincial boundaries too, ultimately damaging national reunification. Whilst it is done with a heavy heart, it is crucial to seeing Hunan's economic recovery to its conclusion."
  
 HNN_zhuzhou_industrial_zone: "Zhuzhou Industrial Zone"
 HNN_zhuzhou_industrial_zone_desc: "Situated upon the Xiang River and the Guangzhou-Wuhan railway, the city of Zhuzhou is but prime real estate for greater economic development. Recently chosen as a site as part of our industrial reform programme, the government hopes to see a rather ambitious development of the city, transforming it into the Zhuzhou Industrial zone due to its sheer potential. Whilst the factories constructed there would be government owned, it will surely boost the might of Hunan's domestic metallurgical and chemical industries."
  
 HNN_reinforce_the_banks_of_hunan: "Reinforce the Banking Sector"
 HNN_reinforce_the_banks_of_hunan_desc: "Not being capable of rivalling the hubs of commerce within Guangzhou, Wuhan or Shanghai, the domestic banks of Hunan have largely either been bought out by enterprises outside provincial control, or otherwise gone bust. Despite bringing stability and profit to the Hunanese financial markets, there are numerous fears that the greater powers that own said institutions would sooner see to it that their assets within Hunan be liquidated when deemed unprofitable, rather than maintain them for the good of the people. Moreover, China is a nation split across many faces, and each one has their own coin. With banks frequently having to contend with a mixture of legal, local and illegal currency, it has led to a serious distrust of the value of Hunan's own provincial currency. Whilst a national currency will have to wait until unification, perhaps with proper government oversight and the establishment of a central bank, we can setup the groundwork for greater development of the province in the future."
  
 HNN_influx_of_capital: "Influx of Capital"
 HNN_influx_of_capital_desc: "The recent surge of currency flows and investments into Hunan has provided the government the tantalising experience of the considerable successes to be made in the future. Prospective investors have examined the possible expansion of our domestic agrarian products like tea, ramie and hemp, others have examined Hunan's desperate need for grand infrastructure projects to truly support our industrial reforms. We shall take full advantage of this new hustle and bustle within the province, ensuring that whatever these investors and their projects need, we can supply it."
  
 HNN_privatise_railroads: "Privatise Railroads"
 HNN_privatise_railroads_desc: "With Hunan's connection to the central Guangzhou-Beijing railway network, the provincial government has frequently seen attempts from private buyers to capitalise on the lucrative potential of such a connection. However all up to now, the ringleaders in Changsha have effectively refused the portioning and sale of such a crucial lifeline for the province. Yet with our industrial reforms progressing readily, and even more potential railroad acquirers, perhaps it is time to finally privatise the railroad. Reducing the government necessity to maintain such a line, whilst presumably producing much needed capital to further create railways throughout the province."

Yet paradoxically, our local experts in industrial matters have struggled to maintain the forward momentum brough about by our education institutions. To supplement this, the government shall embark on a foreign hiring programme, in which those with the knowledge in modern industry and electronics will be invited to train our own workers and managers, so that Hunan's industry is truly brought into the new age."

With renewed government initiative, we shall expand the production our primary exports of tea, ramie, hemp and tobacco, and widen our field of produce to focus on more manufactured goods, such as cotton clothing, and ceramics."
  
 HNN_harmony_in_the_land_harmony_at_home: "Harmony in the Land, Harmony at Home"
 HNN_harmony_in_the_land_harmony_at_home_desc: "How can one truly achieve harmony in the world, if the land itself experiences misfortune? Having once practised restorative farming principles, with the chaos of the Warlord Era and numerous wars Hunan has seen, many have lost their footing with these practices. We cannot blame them, however we can work to once again educate our tillers and toilers on the respectful treatment of Mother Nature, for she grants us her boons, and the least we can do is to pay her in kind."
  
 HNN_negotiating_with_the_landowners: "Negotiating with Landowners"
 HNN_negotiating_with_the_landowners_desc: "The proponents of such a radical redistribution of the land system act in short sighted fury, not truly emphasising a gradual, meticulous approach. Instead of denigrating and disparaging the critical role that the landowners play in our society, why not work with them, to produce a gradual streamlining of the agricultural patchwork, without ruining their livelihoods."
  
 HNN_annihilating_exploitation: "Annihilating Exploitation"
 HNN_annihilating_exploitation_desc: "With the roaring fire of peasant fury that we have lit the flames of, we can utilise the earnest peasants to finally work against the flagrant exploitation of their labour that occurs at present. Whilst the means may be unscrupulous, and considered cruel by many, the peasantry have had to consistently deal with the poor hand dealt to them by the owners of the land they till, and it is time that the government equalises things."

 HNN_alliance_with_the_peasantry_desc: "Established by various local leaders as a counterbalance to the political heavyweights of the landowning class, the peasant councils within Hunan have served valiantly in fighting for the rights of their fellows. However if we provide them ample support for broader expansion, we will not only revolutionise the land, but win the endearing hearts of the populace too."
  
 HNN_for_our_mutual_benefit: "For Our Mutual Benefit"
 HNN_for_our_mutual_benefit_desc: "Despite our continued reiteration that the reforms are necessary to maintain their livelihoods and status, the landowners continue to be hesitant to fully relent to the government's initiatives. Through proper concerted effort however, meeting with heads of local landowning institutions and touring their estates, we can properly convey our message. Whilst they may bemoan our programmes, this is certainly better than outright revolution."
  
 HNN_enhance_tea_manufacturing: "Enhance Tea Manufacturing"
 HNN_enhance_tea_manufacturing_desc: "As critical as it is to the Chinese culture as a whole, tea serves as vital lifeblood for Hunan's economy too. With it amounting to one of our priority exports, before the financial crisis, it ensured an abundance of revenue flowing into the Provincial Government's treasury. With such an important position in the local financial situation, perhaps modernising and mechanising our harvests will yield even greater results."

Arising from a position of chaotic, feudalistic, destitution wiped clean by the fires of Black Monday, a bounding phoenix has emerged from the ashes. With the peasantry and landowners satisfied in their role to play within the provincial economy, let us march hand-in-hand to a new age of prosperity."

 HNN_a_democratic_province_desc: "Unlike other provinces, Hunan is unique in that it has a constitution. Promulgated by Zhao Hengti and twelve others on January 1st, 1922, the Provincial Constitution seeks to uphold the rights of every Hunanese person, be they man, woman, and child. It promises free elections in the province of Hunan, with an elected Provincial Council and an elected Governor. While Zhao holds Hunan's Democracy close to heart, his commitment to his ideals (and the often rowdy Assembly) means that political deadlock is common. The Constitution also has a clause detailing Hunan's \"Monroe Doctrine\", which states that no Hunanese troops shall march out of Hunan, and no other provinces' troops may march into Hunan."

 HNN_perilous_industrial_sector_desc: "To the south lies the Shining Star of the Pearl River Delta, Guangzhou. To the northeast, lies the amalgamation of three industrial cities, Wuhan, and to the west, the practical metropolis of the interior, Chongqing. Yet lying in the crossroads between all of them, are the modest industrial hubs of Changde and Changsha. Towering far above the vast swathes of agrarian tilled land that innumerates Hunan Province, the two cities contribute the largest fair to our industrial capacity. Yet neither have received any due attention, with investors preferring to take their money to greener pastures in neighbouring provinces. This leaves the Hunanese government with a somewhat dangerous situation, for the entire industrial sector hinges on the success of two under-financed urban centres."
  
 HNN_intense_agricultural_imbalance: "Intense Agricultural Imbalance"
 HNN_intense_agricultural_imbalance_desc: "Not unlike the rest of China's interior, Hunan is a largely agricultural economy with scarce urban cities. Numerous villages and farming communities are scattered all throughout, with even more workers tilling their fields. Upon further analysis, one of the most striking characteristics of Hunan's — and the nation's, as a whole — agricultural system is the nigh Feudalistic nightmare that it represents. Local Gentry and Landlords rule their village communities like monarchs and their fiefdoms, and overwhelmingly the populace is worse off for it. However landowner interests are largely something the Changsha government has had to oblige with, for they control the strings that pilot the Hunanese economy."
  
 HNN_derelict_industrial_sector: "Derelict Industrial Sector"
 HNN_derelict_industrial_sector_desc: "The tsunami of Black Monday has finally washed over East Asia, and with the calamity alongside stringent unresting finally causing the death knell of the League, so too has Hunan's meagre industrial offerings gone with it. Like a battering ram, the chaos in the east has crashed through all businesses in Changsha and Changde alike, with small businesses closing, and larger ones making swathes of employees redundant. With our economy completely capsized, the vitality of our urban centres fades, and the government must absolutely act to alleviate the suffering."
  
 HNN_catastrophic_agricultural_crisis: "Catastrophic Agricultural Crisis"
 HNN_catastrophic_agricultural_crisis_desc: "Being mostly agrarian in nature, the global economic downturn has brought the hammer down hard on Hunan's agricultural stability. The once productive, if criminally imbalanced, agrarian situation has swiftly transitioned into a rapidly developing crisis. With money incredibly light, yet harvests continuing, there's a serious inundation of products yet no potential individuals to sell too, resulting in wasted efforts and foodstuffs. Worse yet, the landowners are deeming it necessary to liquidate jobs to protect their assets, causing further unrest."
  
 HNN_stabilising_industrial_sector: "Stabilising Industrial Sector"
 HNN_stabilising_industrial_sector_desc: "With the government finally deigning to address the industrial issue, our industry has seen remarkable stabilisation in line with other global economies throughout the world. Whilst still worse off than before the crisis, businesses are no longer closing, and unemployment is no longer rising. With such chaos lies opportunity, for the government can now work towards rejuvenating the economy from a simple starting position, as the stagnation of the past has been annihilated in economic fury."
  
 HNN_renewed_agricultural_balance: "Renewed Agricultural Balance"
 HNN_renewed_agricultural_balance_desc: "Embarking on a grand mission to revive, and ultimately, improve Hunan's economy, the government's early initiatives alongside the reduction of the landowner's assets and power has resulted in a sort of agricultural equilibrium. Whilst abuses still occur, and the gentry still hold significant sway over the province, the renewed balance has resulted in the blank slate necessary to build Hunan's agriculture in a productive manner."
  
 HNN_independent_industrial_sector: "Independent Industrial Sector"
 HNN_independent_industrial_sector_desc: "Pursuing a policy of economic independence, the government has seen to it that Hunan's industry will work for the Hunanese people, and not foreign investors outside of the provincial borders. Considered a radical policy by proponents of a free market, the government has witnessed what rampant unrestricted capitalism yields, and it's certainly not pretty. "
  
 HNN_developing_industrial_sector: "Developing Industrial Sector"
 HNN_developing_industrial_sector_desc: "Financing Hunan's urban development through the enticement of foreign investors, our economy will take a remarkable open doors policy in the terms of growth. Through incentives, promised stability, and subsidies, Changsha shall become a cornucopia of industrial innovation and manufacturing, rivalling even the towering smokestacks of Manchuria."
  
 HNN_self_sufficient_industry: "Self Sufficient Industry"
 HNN_self_sufficient_industry_desc: "Achieving true economic self sufficiency, the Hunanese government initiatives have yielded an economy that works for the people, not the investors. With wealth slowly developing within our people, their prosperity grows alongside it, and our province is all the better for it. Whilst not renowned by any means, a new era of prosperity has dawned on Hunan's people."
  
 HNN_export_oriented_industry: "Export Oriented Industry"
 HNN_export_oriented_industry_desc: "Not being comparable to the contemporary economies of Tokyo or the West, our industrial situation is still nothing to scoff out. Prioritising our exports, the rapid development of factories and the booming production of goods hs led to a flourishing marvel of excellent economic management. Whilst certainly reliant on the stability of foreign investments and trade, Hunan's economy flourishes nonetheless."
  
 HNN_careful_agricultural_reform: "Careful Agricultural Reform"
 HNN_careful_agricultural_reform_desc: "Foreseeing total land redistribution as inevitably resulting in chaos, Hunan's policymakers have deemed it necessary to initiate a policy of moderated land reform. In which, they implement a series of programmes dedicated to halting the flagrant abuses of the elite landowning class, whilst simultaneously using government funds to purchase and redistribute land to its workers. However even such moderate plans has led to contention from the gentry, concerned that it is merely a ploy of a the Governor to cement his own power further, yet the Governor has still sought to reassure them that this is for the prosperity of the province."
  
 HNN_embers_of_agricultural_redistribution: "Embers of Agricultural Redistribution"
 HNN_embers_of_agricultural_redistribution_desc: "Deliberating that radical action was necessary to salvage and rejuvenate Hunan's shaky agricultural system, the policymakers in Changsha have initiated a programme of limited land redistribution. In which, the government has begun to purchase (and seize) various landowner estates, and selling them to larger families, or peasant councils. Earning much anger from the elites, as to be expected, they have worked to produce attempts to block the government or otherwise obstinate the process, to little result."
  
 HNN_revitalised_agricultural_balance: "Revitalised Agricultural Balance"
 HNN_revitalised_agricultural_balance_desc: "Having reached the conclusion of their agricultural initiatives, the government's measured approach of land reform has seen to the creation of a new, revitalised, agricultural balance. With the scales not necessarily tipped too far in one direction, the leaders in Changsha have seen to a streamlining of Hunan's feudal patchwork landownership. However while more radical members of society may deem it not going far enough, the peasants and gentry of Hunan have seen mutual improvement in their daily lives, and the cries of dissent are largely drowned out."
  
 HNN_peasant_oriented_agriculture: "Peasant Oriented Agriculture"
 HNN_peasant_oriented_agriculture_desc: "Finally concluding their economic programme, the government's peasant focused approach has seemingly yielded considerable benefit to their livelihoods. With support of local peasant cooperatives and councils, alongside the now renewed redistribution of land from the few to the many, Hunan's agricultural system is a true shining star amongst China's agrarian interior. Try as they might, the old elites' attempts to block progress have resulted in futility, and with their power significantly diminished, all shall have their fair share of the land that is toiled."
  
 HNN_peasant_oriented_self_sufficient_economy: "Peasant Oriented Self Sufficient Economy"
 HNN_peasant_oriented_self_sufficient_economy_desc: "Fortuitously the final conclusion and integration of Hunan's economic reforms has yielded a fantastic result. With a reignited focus on Hunan first, the economy has taken a uniquely peasant-province outlook. Prioritising the needs of the peasantry, the workers, and all Hunanese, they can all experience their long overdue reprieve from endless toiling and working, for the meagre scraps granted to them by the \"goodwill\" of foreign financiers and gentry. With the economic sector secure and flourishing, so too shall Hunan prosper within the chaos of the Warlord Era."
  
 HNN_revitalised_export_oriented_economy: "Revitalised Export Oriented Economy"
 HNN_revitalised_export_oriented_economy_desc: "Fortuitously the final conclusion and integration of Hunan's economic reforms has yielded a fantastic result. With a reignited focus on transforming the province into an economic powerhouse, the financial system has taken on a uniquely industrious and modernised outlook. Rivalling the economic might of the League and Fengtian, without any of the dubious strings attached, Hunan's economic success story is that to be marvelled at. Boundless opportunities wait for the Hunanese capitalist utopia."
  
 HNN_peasant_oriented_export_oriented_economy: "Peasant Oriented Export Oriented Economy"
 HNN_peasant_oriented_export_oriented_economy_desc: "In what some ideological hardliners would decry as an esoteric mixture of muddled principles, Hunan's economic reform programmes have produced an eclectic peasant prioritising export economy. For the peasants labour fairly on the fields, and their agricultural production is transformed into goods such as clothing, or luxuries, which are then sold onto international markets.

On one edge, lies the moderated land reform equalising the playing field between the gentry and tillers, whilst maintaining honesty and stability. On the other, a provincial focused development of the urban centres ensuring complete government management of its critical industries. In the end however, the financial situation is better off for it, as the government bears witness to an influx of revenues, and the people experience great wealth.

Благодаря ряду масштабных реформ старая провинция совершенно меркнет по сравнению с новой. В конечном итоге партия завоевала сердца народа и крестьянства, вызвав новую революционную борьбу нации. Действуя как сила народа, партия и крестьянство идут вперед в полной гармонии."

 HNN_revolution_in_the_countryside_idea_desc: "Благодаря широкому сотрудничеству с различными местными крестьянскими организациями и обширной кампании, проводимой нашим отделом пропаганды, Гоминьдану удалось мобилизовать массы Хунани на невиданную доселе свирепость. Намереваясь защищать свою провинцию, чего бы это ни стоило, крестьянство приняло свою собственную форму национальной революции под тщательным руководством партии."
  
 HNN_training_new_cadres: "Обучение новых кадров"
 HNN_training_new_cadres_desc: "В залы провинциальной политико-офицерской академии вливаются потоки новых начинающих членов Гоминьдана. Обучаясь по программе суперинтенданта Тан Шэнчжи, молодые кадры будут погружены в пространство увлеченного обучения и наставничества по Трем принципам доктора Суня. Как и Вампоа, школа надеется подготовить новое поколение революционеров для ведения войны Национальной революции. Однако уникально то, что буддийская философия и добродетели самого Тан Шэнчжи также включены в учебную программу, формируя у офицеров чувство сильной морали и долга."

Отвергая всякое чувство революционного братства, правые выставляют свою интерпретацию Трех принципов как самую ортодоксальную, не запятнанную социалистическими предчувствиями или классовой борьбой. При этом они отказываются видеть многочисленные преимущества сотрудничества между нашими братскими партиями. Давайте с гордостью продемонстрируем всему миру революционное единство Гоминьдана и СПК. Ради светлого будущего для всех, будь то рабочий или крестьянин!"
  
 HNN_consolidating_our_rule: "Укрепляя наше правление"
 HNN_consolidating_our_rule_desc: "Опасения Чжао по поводу полного погружения в революционную борьбу в конечном итоге стали его гибелью. Если бы он не решил присоединиться к вероломным федералистским идеалам Чэнь Цзюнмина, возможно, в другой жизни он был бы прекрасным гоминьдановским товарищем. Однако после ухода Чжао и его союзников-военачальников все еще остается множество институтов старого режима. Давайте работать над тем, чтобы искоренить все остатки коррумпированного федералистского правления."

Чжао, сторонник федерализма, мечтает о свободном Китае, основанном на принципах провинциальной автономии и демократии. Однако внутренние и внешние угрозы ставят под сомнение федералистские планы Чжао.\nНационалистические силы под командованием Чэн Цяня и Тан Шэнчжи скрываются за границами Хунани, готовые к нападению, а адмирал Тан Сянмин будет следить за тем, чтобы влияние Чжили сохранилось в провинции. Сможет ли Чжао защитить демократию в Хунани или провинция падет перед лицом партийно-государственных и милитаристских сил?"

 HNN_country_intro_content: "One of the first Provinces to join the §lXinhai Revolution§! under Governor §RJiao Dafeng§!, Hunan has had a turbulent history over the years. With §RJiao§! dying in battle during the §lXinhai Revolution§!, he was succeeded by §cTan Yankai§! in 1911. §cTan's§! tenure only lasted for two years, however, due to remaining neutral in the conflict between §PYuan Shikai§! and §gSun Yat-sen§!, which led to §PYuan dismissing§! §cTan§! and subsequently replacing him with §PTang Xiangming§!.\n\nFollowing a short Governorship of six months, in part due to §PTang's§! intended purpose as acting Governor, the Province traded hands back and forth between a series of Governors until 1916, which saw §PTang Xiangming§! become Governor once again. This Governorship once more lasted only a few months, with Yunnan Governor §gTang Jiyao§! declaring independence in the wake of §PYuan's§! assumption of the Imperial Throne as §cHongxian Emperor§!. Like a cascade of dominoes, province after province began to follow suit, aligning with Yunnan and declaring independence, and soon enough..."

 HNN_country_intro_content_1: "...Hunan found itself under siege, with local warlord §PTian Yingzhao§! declaring for the NPA being the straw that crushed the camel's back, Admiral §PTang Xiangming§! fled Hunan by boat in the chaos, sailing up the Yangtze. In August, Central Government Premier §PDuan Qirui§! appointed §cTan Yankai§! as Provincial Governor yet again. This Governorship didn't last long either, and after a brief stint by §gCheng Qian§!, §PFu Liangzuo§! and §gZhou Zhaoxiang§!, §PDuan Qirui§! appointed §NZhang Jingyao§! as Governor.\n\nThe infamous \"Butcher of Hunan\" had a regime soaked in blood. Banditry and looting was practically official government policy, with mass unrest raging all throughout the province. The insanity led to §NZhang§! being ousted only two years later when §cTan Yankai§! and his subordinate, §cZhao Hengti§!, joined forces and expelled the Butcher from their Province. Unfortunately for §cTan§!, and much like his previous Governorships, he didn't remain Governor for long.\n\nAs pressure from Federalist intellectuals mounted, §cTan§! hesitated in the creation of an official constitution, and everything culminated with the mutiny of Liling garrison commander §gCheng Qian§!. With Commander-in-Chief §cZhao Hengti§! refusing to assist the Governor, §cTan Yankai§! bowed out and granted the Governorship to §cZhao§! himself."
  
 HNN_country_intro_header_2: "A Decade under §cZhao§!"
 HNN_country_intro_content_2: "With §cZhao Hengti§! becoming the new Governor of Hunan, he immediately proceeded to invite China's best and brightest minds to draft a constitution worthy of Hunan and his Federalist ideals. On January 1st, 1922, §cZhao Hengti§! officially promulgated the \"Hunan Provincial Constitution\", and became the first democratically elected Governor that September.\n\nBetween his civilian reforms, §cZhao Hengti§! protected Jade Marshal §PWu Peifu§! in 1925 after §gFeng Yuxiang§! betrayed him, a favour §PWu§! would repay soon enough. In mid 1926, his two subordinates, §STang Shengzhi§! and §cYe Kaixin§!, had a dispute that §cZhao§! mediated in favour of §cYe§!. Believing the Governor was showing favouritism, §STang Shengzhi§! mutinied and joined the §RKuomintang§! in Guangzhou, kickstarting the Northern Expedition.\n\nThis would lead to §cZhao's§! forces being utterly routed, and kicked out of Hunan. However with §cYe Kaixin's§! assistance, the Federalists asked §PWu Peifu§! for help in retaking the Province. After §PWu Peifu's§! triumph against the Kuomintang, he appointed §cZhao§! as Governor of Hunan.

 hnn.1.t: "Хунань выходит из Лиги"
 hnn.1.d: "После смерти Сунь Чуаньфана Хунань, одна из уже автономных провинций Лиги восьми провинций, вновь обрела полную провинциальную автономию под управлением Чжао Хэнти. Впереди неспокойные времена, а Миньганское восстание угрожает перекинуться и на нашу территорию, поэтому мы должны держать ухо востро. Как выяснилось, мы также должны следить и за западной границей с Юньнанью. Хотя Тан Цзяо - соратник федералистов, его готовность позволить Правому Гоминьдана хозяйничать в западной Гуйчжоу испортила отношения и стала еще одним источником насилия, которое может просочиться в нашу провинцию.\n\nК счастью для нас, север и юг - более безопасные фронты. На юге есть друг - клика Лянгуан, возглавляемая Чэнь Цзюнмином. И Чэнь, и Чжао - родоначальники федералистского движения, одни из единственных демократически избранных лидеров Китая. А к северу от нас находится еще один друг - У Пэйфу и его правительство в Пекине. Чжао питает личную неприязнь к Тан Сянмину, командиру гарнизона Чжили в Юэяне, за то, что тот арестовал его и бросил в тюрьму в 1913 году. Несмотря на это, он по-прежнему лично дружит с У Пэйфу, и эти двое знают друг друга уже более десяти лет, а значит, на клику Чжили можно рассчитывать как на одного из наших союзников в Китае."
 hnn.1.a: "Тщательное балансирование..."
  
 hnn.2.t: "Восстановление конституции провинции Хунань"
 hnn.2.d: "Чжао Хэнти, губернатор, пришел к власти в 1920-х годах благодаря федералистскому движению, и его первыми действиями у власти стало собрание интеллектуалов со всего Китая для написания конституции Хунани, которую, к сожалению, не удалось восстановить, пока она находилась под властью Чжили. Однако с распадом Лиги и хаосом 1936 года в Китае у губернатора Чжао наконец появилась возможность восстановить Конституцию, которую он помог создать более десяти лет назад.\n\nВ то время как другие, даже федералисты, предостерегают от создания провинциальной Конституции без центрального федерального правительства, губернатор Чжао считает, что федерализм должен сначала возникнуть на провинциальном уровне, что каждая провинция должна свергнуть своих военачальников, создать свои собственные провинциальные Конституции и построить демократию в своих провинциях. Только тогда конфедерация провинций сможет сформировать центральное правительство, и федералистское движение восторжествует.\n\nИмея в виду этот идеал, Чжао официально объявил, что конституция провинции Хунань восстановлена с сегодняшнего дня!"
 hnn.2.a: "Важный шаг в будущее!"
  
 #Election Events 
  
 hnn.election.1.t: "Выборы объявлены"
 hnn.election.1.d: "С восстановлением конституции провинции Хунань пламя демократии снова мерцает на перекрестке Китая. Чжао выступил сегодня перед у входа в резиденцию губернатора в Чанше, заявив, что выборы состоятся через три месяца, и объявив о выдвижении своей собственной кандидатуры на выборах под знаменем своего Общества Народного Обновления. Важно отметить, что губернатор провинции Хунань не избирается напрямую, а работает по парламентской системе: избиратели выбирают своих выборщиков, а те голосуют за губернатора, причем любому кандидату требуется большинство голосов, чтобы получить пост губернатора. Прошло совсем немного времени, и еще два кандидата объявили о своей гонке. Основным соперником Чжао в этой гонке будет Хуан Янпэй из Китайской Национальной Ассоциации Строительства Демократии. Третий кандидат и темная лошадка гонки - независимый политик Чжоу Шичжао. Хотя у него нет собственной партии, он пользуется заметным влиянием среди наиболее левых членов Ассамблеи, своих коллег по политической независимости. И наконец, Тан Янкай, человек, примыкающий и к федералистскому движению, и к Гоминьдану, объявил, что будет баллотироваться против Чжао и может подорвать его электоральную базу.\n\nХотя Чжао - явный фаворит на победу, все три кандидата вложат все силы в свои кампании, и в ближайшие месяцы в Хунани пройдут действительно демократические выборы, пример для подражания всему Китаю!"
 hnn.election.1.a: "За молодую демократию Хунаня!"
  
 hnn.election.2.t: "Тан Шэнчжи отправляется в Хунань"
 hnn.election.2.d: "Генерал Тан Шэнчжи, прославленный командующий 8-й армией в Северном походе и боевой товарищ Миньгана, по сообщениям, довольно быстро уведомил своих коллег-генералов Дэн Яньда и Ли Цзишэня о своем желании участвовать в недавно объявленных выборах в провинции Хунань. На фоне хаоса, царящего в ходе войны Лиги, многие командиры в зоне повстанцев выразили явный гнев по поводу внезапного ухода генерала-изгоя, обвинив его и его сторонников в том, что они, возможно, жертвуют самим выживанием Гоминьдана ради шанса получить власть в Хунани.\n\nОднако, как бы они ни старались, Тан и остатки его 8-й армии уже покинули свои командные пункты и, скорее всего, в данный момент пересекают границу провинции, так что, увы, их крики осуждения останутся неуслышаны. Несмотря на то, что его гамбит может закончиться неудачей, генерал-изгой, возможно, обеспечит Национальной революции всю провинцию Хунань. Только время покажет, что выльется из этого."
 hnn.election.2.a: "По крайней мере, удачи"
  
 hnn.election.3.t: "Тан Шэнчжи прибывает в Хунань"
 hnn.election.3.d1: "Тревожные новости достигли офиса губернатора в Чанше. На фоне хаоса войны Лиги и восстаний гоминьдановцев в провинции Фуцзянь изгнанный гоминьдановский губернатор Хунани и повстанец Миньгана Тан Шэнчжи, по сообщениям, пересек границу провинции. В сопровождении своих подчиненных Хэ Луна, Пэн Дэхуая и небольшого отряда 8-й армии генерал, похоже, решил бросить вызов Чжао Хэнти на недавно объявленных выборах.\n\nБыв ранее подчиненным Чжао и сместив его накануне Северного похода, Тан Шэнчжи всегда хотел занять пост губернатора родной Хунани даже во время своего пребывания в зоне повстанцев. Благодаря своим связям с крестьянством и левыми по всей провинции, он показал себя серьезным соперником на национальных выборах, всколыхнув то, что считалось гарантированной победой Чжао."
 hnn.election.3.d2: "Тревожные новости достигли офиса губернатора в Чанше. На фоне хаоса войны Лиги и неудачных восстаний гоминьдановцев в провинции Фуцзянь изгнанный гоминьдановский губернатор Хунани и повстанец Миньгана Тан Шэнчжи, по сообщениям, пересек границу провинции, спасаясь от разрушений, причиненных его товарищам. В сопровождении своих подчиненных Хэ Луна, Пэн Дэхуая и небольшого отряда 8-й армии генерал, похоже, решил бросить отчаянный вызов Чжао Хэнти на выборах.\n\nБыв ранее подчиненным Чжао и сместив его накануне Северного похода, Тан Шэнчжи всегда хотел занять пост губернатора родной Хунани даже во время своего пребывания в зоне повстанцев. Благодаря своим связям с крестьянством и левыми по всей провинции, он показал себя серьезным соперником на национальных выборах - с помощью или без помощи Гоминьдана.\n\nХотя он вполне может быть последним, отчаянно цепляющимся за жизнь гоминьдановцем, он все же испортил то, что считалось гарантированной победой Чжао."
 hnn.election.3.a: "Одного Тана было уже достаточно..."
  
 hnn.election.4.t: "Cheng Qian invades through Guizhou!"
 hnn.election.4.d: "Another startling upset has found itself within the Hunan Provincial Governor Election. Whilst MinGan was a hotbed of Kuomintang sentiment, it had always taken on a uniquely leftist spin within the broader political sphere. As the Northern Expedition collapsed however, those who opposed the collaboration with the Chinese Syndicalist Party largely fled to Guizhou province — now split between the cliques of Hunan and Yunnan — remaining nominally under the protection of Yunnan Governor Tang Jiyao.\n\nWhilst Tang Jiyao is certainly not a member of the Kuomintang, the existence of the \"Right\" Kuomintang within Guizhou was frequently used as a bargaining chip against perceived Zhili encroachment, even at the expense of Tang's own Federalist brotherhood with Zhao Hengti.\n\nOne of the critical leaders within RKMT Guizhou, Cheng Qian, is a Hunanese native and was commander of the National Revolutionary Army's 6th Army during the Northern Expedition. In what appears to be an uncoordinated advance with his fellow party member Tang Shengzhi, the General has circumvented Yuan Zuming, and thrown his hat into the election."
 hnn.election.4.a: "This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!"
  
 hnn.election.5.t: "The Campaign begins in Hengyang"
 hnn.election.5.d: "Two days ago, Governor Zhao Hengti returned to his home city of Hengyang, in the hopes that he would convince the people from his hometown to vote for him. He visited his family along with old childhood friends, and made multiple speeches around the city, gathering the attention of many people. Despite appearances from both Cheng Qian and Tang Shengzhi, Zhao easily drew the largest crowds with his impassioned speeches, his campaigning in Hengyang ending with a triumph.\n\nZhao's popularity, naturally, poses a threat to both men in the Kuomintang. With neither seemingly able to beat Zhao alone, they have met in Hengyang after their speeches, and made discussions of a \"United Front\" between their different factions. While the two men are not friends, they'd rather see a fellow Kuomintang Comrade win the Governorship than the Federalist Zhao."
 hnn.election.5.a: "Zhao Hengti shall continue Hunan's democratic legacy!"
 hnn.election.5.b: "The Kuomintang shall bring the National Revolution to Hunan!"
  
 hnn.election.6.t: "Who leads the United Front?"
 hnn.election.6.d: "With Cheng Qian and Tang Shengzhi agreeing on a United Front, an immediate question cropped up of who exactly should lead the United Front?\n\nOn one hand, you have Tang Shengzhi, aligned with the left wing of the party, his peasant focus and cooperation with the CSP makes him a naturally popular candidate, given Hunan's rural and agrarian nature. The concern however, is his status as a party outsider, a warlord and opportunist turned Kuomintang member, may serve to splinter the unity of the party when it needs to be most united.\n\nOn the other hand, you have Cheng Qian, a party insider who values unity and comradare of the Party greatly, and could easily serve as a moderate and unifying figure for the election. A member of the old guard, he's well known for his stubborn nature, and while not the best commander ever, still has a decent record behind him. The concern is that he may not bring as much to the table as his more radical counterpart.\n\nBoth men have advantages and disadvantages to being the leader of this United Front, but we can only pick one of them to take charge, who shall it be?"
 hnn.election.6.a: "Party Unity is paramount, Cheng shall lead the front"
 hnn.election.6.b: "We need a radical firebrand, give Tang the reigns"
  
 hnn.election.7.t: "A Deal with the Devil?"
 hnn.election.7.d: "The sudden appearance of Cheng Qian and Tang Shengzhi has put Governor Zhao in a tough spot. Well aware of the Authoritarian and Vanguardist tendencies of the Kuomintang, he worries that if they win this election for Governor Hunan's young democracy may be snuffed out. Wanting to avoid this at all costs, he has been pacing in his office mulling over one of his less... honourable options to winning the election. The Provincial Assembly is famously corrupt, and the Governor lacks the power to move against the corruption, despite his best attempts nothing seems to lessen it. These corrupt Assemblymen may not care for Hunan's democracy, but they don't hold any loyalty to the Kuomintang...\n\nIt would certainly be possible to find common ground with them, and gain their support in the upcoming election, provided Zhao was willing to... turn a blind eye to their corruption, both during and after the election. It would be regrettable to aid and abet corruption like this, but when push comes to shove, bending the rules is better than breaking them."
 hnn.election.7.a: "I am a man of principle!"
 hnn.election.7.b: "It's unfortunate, but needs must."
  
 hnn.election.8.t: "Unrest amongst the Far Left"
 hnn.election.8.d: "Ever since Tang Shengzhi's arrival through the east, socialist unrest in Hunan has increased dramatically. On the border with Jiangxi socialist militia's have been harassing members of Zhao's Government, violence breaking out frequently and order breaking down. At the same time the cities of Changsha and Changde have had increased action by union workers and the Chinese Syndicalist Party, protests breaking out in both cities as the Kuomintang stoke the flames of unrest.\n\nTang Shengzhi has capitalised on this, speaking at length at how this unrest is a natural evolution of Zhao's failures to take care of Hunan's workers, and that under the Kuomintang every worker would be given their dues.\n\nZhao quickly countered Tang's claims, pointing out that it was Tang Shengzhi and the Kuomintang who has fanned the flames of this unrest, actively encouraged the violence on the border, and now is trying to promise that they'll be the ones to the problem they themselves caused."
 hnn.election.8.a: "Tang reaches out to the Socialist cause"
 hnn.election.8.b: "The violence frightens people to flock to Zhao's banner."
  
 hnn.election.9.t: "Tan Yankai's choice"
 hnn.election.9.d: "Within Changsha, there's the former Governor of Hunan, and former member of the Kuomintang, in Tan Yankai. When the Northern Expedition collapsed Zhao offered him amnesty, on account of their old friendship, and safety from the reprisals from Beijing and Nanjing. With the recent elections being announced, he decided to run against Zhao for Governor, mainly soaking up seats in Changsha and among the Gentry, undercutting some of Zhao's own support base.\n\nThe question on his mind today is that, with the Kuomintang United Front between Tang Shengzhi and Cheng Qian, does he fold under the Kuomintang's banner or continue his campaign as an independent? While a leader during the Northern Expedition and member of the Kuomintang, he dislikes both Tang and Cheng on a personal level. Furthermore his main base of support is within the Gentry, so tying his name to the Socialist violence in Changsha and the east would be a dangerous move for him to make."
 hnn.election.9.a: "Run as an independent."
 hnn.election.9.b: "Run under the KMT banner."
  
 hnn.election.10.t: "Campaign in Changsha"
 hnn.election.10.d: "Changsha has grown greatly in recent years, spurred by economic change and the beginnings of industrialisation. With Tan Yankai splitting the gentry away from Zhao, he is instead banking on his support among the intellectuals in Changsha. The middle class, for their part, have grown distant from his administration, starting to look towards Cheng Qian and his promises instead. Both men are trying to court the city and swing votes in it to their side, with Zhao appealing to the intellectuals and to defending the work he has already done for Changsha and Hunan, meanwhile Cheng has been talking to the middle class in Changsha, speaking of reforming the system to benefit them, and encourage more development in the city if they vote for him. Tang Shengzhi is notably absent, his rural focused campaigns unable to gain enough traction in Changsha, so he has chosen to support Cheng in the city. Both men have a solid shot at swinging the city in their favour, but who's rhetoric will win over the most voters?"
 hnn.election.10.a: "Zhao's popularity among the intelligentsia give him the city!"
 hnn.election.10.b: "Cheng's promises of reform earn him the support of the middle class!"
  
 hnn.election.11.t: "The minor Liberal parties"
 hnn.election.11.d: "With the Kuomintang sweeping support with their populist rhetoric, the liberals running for Governor, Huang Yanpei and Zhou Shizhao, have an important choice to make. Neither of them wish to see the light of democracy in Hunan get snuffed out, as seems likely if the Kuomintang achieve victory. As such they have considered the option of dropping out as contenders for the Governorship, and formally endorsing Zhao, folding under his banner in order to create an \"democratic front\" against the Kuomintang. On the other hand, they can always continue their bids for Governor, trying to carve out their own niche in the Assembly, and discuss negotiations with Zhao after the post-election Assembly forms. Both options have their merits, but what strategy shall they go with?"
 hnn.election.11.a: "Fold under the Federalist Banner."
 hnn.election.11.b: "Continue running their candidates."
  
 hnn.election.12.t: "The Yueyang Garrison"
 hnn.election.12.d: "On the border with Hubei lies the city of Yueyang, and important chokepoint between our Province and the northern Government. This city is presently run as Tang Xiangming's personal fiefdom, with his brother, Tang Hualong, as the city's mayor. Neither man is a friend of Zhao's, Tang Xiangming even arrested Zhao in 1913 on Yuan Shikai's behalf, and threw him in a Beijing Prison. Despite this both men do have sympathies with the Zhili clique, and there's been an uneasy truce between them, although it's been particularly fraught with the League Collapse.\n\nThe Tang brothers have met today in Yueyang to discuss their strategy with the upcoming election. Tang Hualong, fearing a Kuomintang victory, has suggested Tang Xiangming make a truce with Zhao for now and focus efforts on blocking the Kuomintang from seizing power in Hunan. Tang Xiangming, not truly believing the Kuomintang can succeed in the election, disagrees with his brother, and states that they must minimise Zhao's success, lest the Federalist gets a big head from his victory in Hunan."
 hnn.election.12.a: "Tang Xiangming is right, keep Zhao contained"
 hnn.election.12.b: "Tang Hualong has a point, the KMT are the greater threat"
  
 hnn.election.13.t: "Clashes between Classes"
 hnn.election.13.d: "Podiums and campaigns aren't the only battlegrounds during this election. With the Kuomintang's appearance and fiery rhetoric directed at the peasantry, there has been a massive wave of unrest, directed right at the upper class, the landed Gentry. With one member of the Gentry even being attacked by a number of peasants, who were subsequently arrested for assault.\n\nWith this violence seemingly escalating in nature, Zhao has met with many prominent members of the Gentry, listening to their concerns and trying to calm their fears, and humbly asking for their support in the coming election, that he would be able to solve the problems plaguing them.\n\nTang, on the other hand, has given yet another speech to the peasantry, saying that their political ascension is nigh, and that as long as they keep pushing forth and fighting they will win everything they desire.\n\nCheng, ever the moderate, has been significantly calmer than Tang. Speaking positively of the peasantry's actions, he still emphasises the need for compromise, that everyone involved is a citizen of Hunan and of China, and that together they could build a brighter future for everybody."
 hnn.election.13.a: "Zhao calms the Gentry's fears."
 hnn.election.13.b: "Tang fans the flames of peasant unrest."
 hnn.election.13.c: "Cheng does his best to mediate between all parties."
  
 hnn.election.14.t: "The Xiangxi Diarchy"
 hnn.election.14.d: "In the west of Hunan lies the Xiangxi Diarchy between Tian Yingzhao and Chen Quzhen, warlords in their own right, they've spent the last decade or so within Zhao Hengti's clique. Although within recent years Tang Xiangming has made more concerted efforts to sway the two to his own sphere of influence. While Tian joining the Constitutional Protection Alliance did lead to Tang Xiangming's resignation as Governor, relations between the two have healed since then.\n\nWith the popularity of the Kuomintang in the election, and their clear rhetoric pointed at \"Hunan's western warlords\" and the need to remove them, the Diarchy is naturally worried about the results of this election. They have two options clearly open to them, either they can throw their own electoral bloc and resources towards securing a victory for Zhao. Or they could instead respond to Tang Xiangming's overtures, and form an \"Anti-KMT alliance\" in case the wrong person wins this upcoming election."
 hnn.election.14.a: "Tang Xiangming will keep order."
 hnn.election.14.b: "Zhao's victory will keep them at bay."
  
 hnn.election.15.t: "Campaign in the Countryside"
 hnn.election.15.d: "Governor Zhao's support, historically speaking, has mainly come from the urban cities. This election cycle is no different, with large scale apathy among the peasantry towards Zhao's Administration, he is functionally unable to win over the majority of their votes. The Kuomintang's two candidates however, are a different story. Tang Shengzhi has a particular focus towards the peasantry, and has been making broad promises of land reform and support for peasant organisations. Cheng Qian, while still promising similar efforts of land reform, doesn't go quite as far as his leftist counterpart. However, if he redoubles his efforts and pushes for rural campaigns he may be able to take rural seats from Tang, and secure them for himself."
 hnn.election.15.a: "Tang's rhetoric ensures the support of the peasantry!"
 hnn.election.15.b: "Cheng narrowly gains a plurality of support!"
  
 hnn.election.16.t: "Changsha and Guizhou"
 hnn.election.16.d: "West of Hunan lies Guizhou, and with it the leader of the Old Guizhou Clique, Yuan Zuming. While technically a Governor in his own right, and recognised by the Zhili as such, he lacks the strength to stand on his own, and as such he has to rely on the Government in Changsha. While Zhao and Yuan don't agree on much, both have sympathies with the Zhili, and have decided it's best for both if they work together. With Cheng Qian making it past Yuan and through Guizhou, and Zhao focusing on the election, their alliance has begun to become more tenuous as of late. Zhao has been debating on if he should pull some of the funding going to Guizhou and instead focus on improving his odds of reelection in these final days, at the cost of angering his ally in the west. At the same time, Cheng has been speaking heavily on Yuan and his \"Autocratic Regime\" in Guizhou, that he will not stand for it any longer, and that if the Kuomintang is elected they will no longer support Yuan's regime."
 hnn.election.16.a: "Cheng Qian's anti-Yuan position proves popular!"
 hnn.election.16.b: "Zhao undercuts support to focus on the KMT and the Election."
  
 hnn.election.17.t: "Election results are in!"
 hnn.election.17.d: "The votes have been counted, and Hunan's Provincial Election is coming to a close. All candidates involved have given it their all, but it's clear to everyone that the People's Renewal Society and the Kuomintang are the frontrunners. Going in it was unclear which of the two would be the winner in the election, while Zhao started as the clear favourite to win, Cheng and Tang's united front shook up the race in an unexpected way, with them gaining a lot of ground and serving as strong rivals for Zhao. All that's left now is for the results to be announced, the future of Hunan rests on this result, and we await the winner with bated breath..."

 #Tang Xiangming Events 
  
 hnn.zhili.1.t: "The March on Changsha"
 hnn.zhili.1.d.qing: "With our recent victory in the election, the Zhili forces occupying Yueyang, led by Tang Xiangming, have descended by rail and arrived in Changsha within hours. While we could likely take his forces, currently north of Changsha, on their own, we managed to secure a report that said Beijing was sending reinforcements. Cheng Qian and Tang Shengzhi decided to dig in and try and hold Changsha. Unfortunately Tang Xiangming's reinforcements have moved in, reinforcing the north and creating a second front on the east, pincering the city and our forces, our prospect look dire indeed..."
 hnn.zhili.1.d.zhao: "With our failures to contain the lingering Kuomintang remnants across Hunan, Yueyang Garrison leader Tang Xiangming has declared our Government to be incapable of \"Protecting the steadfast and loyal citizens of the Hunan Province\" and has vowed he would March on Changsha to \"Install a Government truly dedicated to the safety and security of all of Hunan\". He quickly made good on this promise, using the rail line to bring his army down from Yueyang in a matter of hours, with our forces still tied down across Hunan, trying to crush the insurgents in our province, we were unable to rally a formidable counter assault, Tang Xiangming's victory appears to be certain..."
 hnn.zhili.1.d: "With our recent victory in the election, the Zhili forces occupying Yueyang, led by Tang Xiangming, have descended by rail and arrived in Changsha within hours. Luckily for us, he seems to only have his garrison, with no extra reinforcements to speak of. Seeing an opportunity, Tang Shengzhi quickly moved out with his Eighth Army, and met the force outside Changsha. Cheng Qian only learned of this after the fact, quickly bringing his Sixth Army out to reinforce Tang... oddly enough however, Hunan's Provincial Army seems to still be in Changsha, not moving to reinforce their Governor."
 hnn.zhili.1.a: "Tang Xiangming seizes Changsha!"
 hnn.zhili.1.b: "The Kuomintang stand triumphant!"
  
 hnn.zhili.2.t: "A New Man in Changsha"
 hnn.zhili.2.d: "Tang Xiangming walked down the streets of Changsha, his forces still stationed on nearly every street corner. It had been a long time since he could call himself Governor of Hunan, he had last occupied that position in 1916, two decades ago now. His control over the province was not absolute yet, the previous Governor's forces retreating quickly to the countryside, insurgents loyal to the Kuomintang raiding and striking at any of his own troops. He walked into the Governor's office, and officially signed the order for his troops to move out. Governor Tang Xiangming would ensure absolute control of Hunan by any means necessary."
 hnn.zhili.2.a: "Now to take the rest."
  
 hnn.zhili.3.t: "Governor [ROOT.GetLeader] Victorious"
 hnn.zhili.3.d: "Despite catching the Kuomintang United Front by surprise, Tang Xiangming's forces were immediately met by the best and brightest of the National Revolutionary Army's 8th and 6th armies. Having directed his forces directly down the rail line towards Changsha, the admiral was met by the rapidly deployed forces of Song Xilian, who engaged him in gruelling combat.\n\nWith the spearhead blunted, the rest of the 6th and 8th armies were able to rapidly join in the fighting. Following clever manoeuvres by He Jian, his division managed to flank the Zhili forces and attack Tang's weaker columns in conjunction with actions by He Long and Peng Dehuai, who managed to completely encircle the Zhili troops. Ultimately ending in the surrender of the warlord forces, the engagement bolstered the morale of the Kuomintang's forces and propelled the concept that the United Front may be one to last.\n\nAll throughout the nation, the news of the Zhili rout in Hunan has received acclamation from many, including those of the radical revolutionaries in the Central Committee, the Rightist KMT remnant in Guizhou, and most curiously, from the likes of [YUN.GetLeader] and [FNG.GetLeader]. Nonetheless, the fleeing \"Butcher of Hunan\" managed to flee capture, having broken out of the encirclement with a company of his elite troops, and has reportedly crossed into friendly territory."
 hnn.zhili.3.a: "Hopefully the last we see of him."
  
 hnn.zhili.4.t: "Restoring Order in Hunan"
 hnn.zhili.4.d: "While nominally the new Governor of Hunan, our control over the province was limited to the northeast. That was until recently, our troops swept south and west, crushing any Kuomintang or Federalist loyalists they found. One by one the cities of Hengyang, Chenzhou, and Shaoyang fell under our grip. Governor Tang Xiangming himself moved out west, meeting with Chen Quzhen of the Xiangxi Diarchy, and ensuring that they wouldn't cause problems for our Governor. With the Diarchy submitting to our rule, the Province of Hunan is firmly in our grasp."
 hnn.zhili.4.a: "All under the Governor."
  
 hnn.zhili.5.t: "Securing Eastern Guizhou"
 hnn.zhili.5.d: "With Hunan secured, Tang moved his sights to Eastern Guizhou, under the Zhili aligned Yuan Zuming. Keeping his army in western Hunan just in case, the two Governor's met for talks. Negotiations were brief, all things considered, as Tang Xiangming promised to uphold the relationship Yuan enjoyed with the past administration, and Yuan stated any Kuomintang remnants left in his own province would be treated like the traitors they were. Certain topics, such as Guizhou's division and the Yunnan clique, did not come up, but were scheduled to be discussed at a future date."
 hnn.zhili.5.a: "It's good that he can see reason."
  
 hnn.zhili.6.t: "The Defence Commission"
 hnn.zhili.6.d: "Given the threats Hunan faces, the insurgents of the Kuomintang still lurking in our midsts, the nearby powers eyeing our lands hungrily, it has become necessarily for Governor Tang to establish the \"Commission for the Defence of the Hunan Province\". An extra-judicial body that grants the Governor sweeping Executive powers in matters related to the defence of the Province. What this means in practice is that Governor Tang has greater ability to defend Hunan from the threats all around it. It may seem like an undue lurch towards Authoritarianism, but it is necessary for the safety and security of every loyal Hunanese citizen."
 hnn.zhili.6.a: "For a safe and secure society."
  
 hnn.zhili.7.t: "Eliminating the KMT"
 hnn.zhili.7.d: "Under Zhao Hengti the Kuomintang has been allowed to exist uninhibited, grow and spread across Hunan like a sickness. In the name of democracy Zhao refused to move against them during his election, allowing the wound they've created in Hunan to fester and grow infected. Luckily for Hunan, Governor Tang is more than willing to root out the cause of this pain, and to finally eradicate this infection from our province.\n\nHis action was swift and decisive, Kuomintang insurgents still willing to attack were crushed by our armies, thrown in prison or given swift justice. Quickly growing a culture of fear against the self proclaimed \"Revolutionaries\", many threw down their weapons and went into hiding, either within our Province, or by fleeing from it.\n\nOne unexpected side effect of the Governor's efforts is the circle of figures, primarily those in the Gentry who fear what the Kuomintang would do to them if they took power, have begun to form a political circle around Governor Tang. Many of these men are currently in the Assembly, or have many in the Assembly on their payroll. During a large meeting with them in Changsha, and after relatively quick discussion with many of the most esteemed members of the elite, these men agreed to form the \"Harmony Association\", taking the same name as the organisation in Beijing, with Tang Xiangming at it's head. With this development Governor Tang's control over the Assembly has grown even deeper than before, and he's beginning to find that more civilian figures are willing to support his regime."
 hnn.zhili.7.a: "Let's hope they stay down this time."
  
 hnn.zhili.8.t: "A Gamble for the Coast"
 hnn.zhili.8.d: "Governor Tang Xiangming is, and always has been, a man of the sea. Originally an Admiral far before he was a General, it is more than apparent to him the irony of him being Governor of a landlocked province. To rectify this fact, he has put together are plan to strike south, at Guangxi and Guangdong, and seize the port city of Guangzhou. While he feels confident in his own plan, he will need to justify it to Zhili leadership and get them on board with the plan. To this end he has created a petition that he will send to [HNN_zhili_home_base], and with hope they will see reason and allow him to make his march south, and secure Liangguang for the Zhili clique... and for himself."
 hnn.zhili.8.a: "Send the Petition."
  
 hnn.zhili.9.t: "A Petition from Changsha"
 hnn.zhili.9.d: "[HNN_a_petition_from_changsha_loc_desc]"
 HNN_a_petition_from_changsha_loc_desc_qie_gxc: "A petition has come to us from Changsha today. The new Governor there, Tang Xiangming, has suggested that he moves against the regime in Liangguang. A swift strike south when they're still recovering from war could serve to give us the traditionally turbulent twin provinces, which would certainly be a welcomed change from their usually hostile attitude towards our Government. In fact one of our own Admirals, Sa Zhenbing, has spoken out in favour of his former subordinate, stating that he trusts their judgement, and that this is a great opportunity to secure the Southern Coast. The risk, however, is that bringing our army south in assistance with Tang Xiangming may leave us open to other threats in China, chief of all being the Fengtian Clique in the Northeast..\n\nWhat shall we do? Do we accept Governor Tang's petition and let him make his gambit? Or do we deny it, keep our cards close to our chest, and focus on retaining what we have?"
 HNN_a_petition_from_changsha_loc_desc_szc_gxc: "A petition has come to us from Changsha today. The new Governor there, Tang Xiangming, has suggested that he moves against the regime in Liangguang. A swift strike south when they're still recovering from war could serve to give us the traditionally turbulent twin provinces, which would certainly be a welcomed change from their usually hostile attitude towards our Government. Given our position on the backfoot, securing more of the South, especially wealthy Guangdong, would be a helpful boon for us. The risk, of course, is the threat of the Manchu right on our door, and that if we bring our army down south it may leave us open for attack from the North.\n\nWhat shall we do? Do we accept Governor Tang's petition and let him make his gambit? Or do we deny it, keep our cards close to our chest, and focus on retaining what we have?"
 HNN_a_petition_from_changsha_loc_desc_qie_szc: "With Governor Tang Xiangming's successful capture of Guangzhou, and his formation of the Southwest China Political Council, another petition has arrived from him today. With the Sichuan clique, on our border, being aligned against us, he has suggested that we march together on the clique, and he will incorporate it into his Southwest Political Council. The benefit of this is obvious, securing our Southwestern flank would be invaluable for us. The question is if we want to keep empowering Governor Tang, while he has proven steadfast and loyal in the past, empowering an autonomous political council may serve as a headache in our future.\n\nSo the question remains, shall we accept the Governor's petition, and let him march on Sichuan? Or do we deny it, and try to keep his ambitions in check?"
 HNN_a_petition_from_changsha_loc_desc_qie_yun: "With Governor Tang Xiangming's successful capture of Guangzhou, and his formation of the Southwest China Political Council, another petition has arrived from him today. Historically troublesome, the Yunnan clique is yet again unwilling to recognise Beijing as the legitimate Government of China. Governor Tang's petition asks for us to handle this thorn in both our sides immediately, reclaiming the rest of Guizhou for Yuan Zuming and incorporating Yunnan into his political council. While certainly a meddlesome province in the past, do we wish to grant Tang even greater power than he already has? Either way we need to respond to the petition sooner rather than later."
 HNN_a_petition_from_changsha_loc_desc_szc_yun: "With Governor Tang Xiangming's successful capture of Guangzhou, and his formation of the Southwest China Political Council, another petition has arrived from him today. Now trapped between ourselves and Tang's territory, Yunnan is encircled and unable to expand without attacking us. Governor Tang believes this is a threat, and that they will stab us in the back the moment we march North or East. His petition is to preempt a Yunnanese attack by striking first, to reclaim Guizhou for Yuan Zuming and incorporating Yunnan into his political council. He is certainly right that Yunnan could stab us in the back, but do we really want to spend our manpower and guns on empowering Tang, when there are still clear threats abound? There is merits to it, but we must think carefully before we make our choice..."
 hnn.zhili.9.a: "Fortune favours the bold, accept the petition!"
 hnn.zhili.9.b: "We must be cautious, lest we lose everything, reject the petition."

 HNN_petition_accepted_loc_desc_gxc: "Good news has arrived from [HNN_zhili_home_base], after careful consideration by the Zhili leadership they have decided to accept our petition to march South against Liangguang. Upon getting permission Governor Tang Xiangming quickly readied his army and brought it to the southern border of Hunan. Both he and our men are raring to go, just waiting on the order to move past the border and march south. Governor Tang, for his part, can already envision the ocean view from Guangzhou, he's spent the better part of ten years looking out at Dongting Lake from his residence in Yueyang, but soon he would be able to see out to the real ocean, the salt in the air and wind on the sea. With that vision in mind, he gave the order."
 HNN_petition_accepted_loc_desc_szc: "Good new has arrived from Beijing. Correctly recognising Governor Tang's arguments, and the second front Sichuan, clearly positioning itself against Beijing, could easily open against them, they have agreed to the Governor's petition to march on Chongqing. Coordinating a joint invasion with Beijing, Governor Tang has moved his troops south as Wu position his own in the north, with any luck the conflict will be short, and Sichuan shall be incorporated into the Southwest China Political Council posthaste."
 HNN_petition_accepted_loc_desc_yun: "Good new has arrived from [HNN_zhili_home_base], they have correctly recognised the Governor's arguments, the threat Yunnan poses to stab them in the back, and has accepted his petition to march on Kunming. Governor Tang has called his army and begun to move it west, sending a telegram to Guizhou Governor Yuan Zuming, telling him that he shall regain control of the rest of his Province soon enough! All we need do is give the order to march on Kunming."

 hnn.zhili.11.t: "Our Petition is Rejected"
 hnn.zhili.11.d: "Disappointing news has arrived from [HNN_zhili_home_base], after some consideration by Zhili leadership they have decided to deny our petition to march against our would-be enemies. Governor Tang is understandably disappointed by this news, but with his own sense of loyalty and belief in the chain of command, he has accepted their decision with grace and dignity. With outward expansion outright rejected, Governor Tang has turned his attention inwards, towards consolidating his position as Governor and properly entrenching himself within the Hunan Province."
 hnn.zhili.11.a: "Disappointing, but we must accept it."
  
 hnn.zhili.12.t: "Our Friends in Guizhou"
 hnn.zhili.12.d: "[HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang Xiangming of [HNN_tang_xiangming_domain] and Governor Yuan Zuming of Guizhou met on the border today, their armies performing joint drills to ensure the fighting capability of both forces. As they were observing their troops movements, Governor Yuan took [HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang aside, [HNN_friends_in_guizhou_end_text]"
 hnn.zhili.12.guizhou.split: "and brought up the situation in Guizhou and the Yunnan clique. Stating that he'd be happy to offer greater to support to Hunan, if they were willing to do their part in returning Guizhou to it's rightful ruler.\n\nGovernor Tang agreed, telling Governor Yuan that he would do everything in his power to restore the control of Guizhou to the proper authorities, and that he hoped this day would mark an even stronger alliance going forth, Hunan and Guizhou working hand in hand."
 hnn.zhili.12.guizhou.united: "speaking on the recent reclamation of Guizhou and on him officially joining the Southwestern China Political Council.\n\nThanking Tang Xiangming for assisting him in recovering his home province, he briefly spoke on his hopes for a close and fruitful alliance, and stating that he wished for Guiyang and Changsha to work more closely in the future. The Inspector-General agreed, ensuring that they would be able to work together against the threats against them, and that with unity would come strength."
 hnn.zhili.12.a: "To a long and fruitful partnership!"
  
 hnn.zhili.13.t: "Flight of the Federalists"
 hnn.zhili.13.d: "With the poison of the Kuomintang removed from Hunan, Governor Tang set his sights on a far more insidious foe, the Federalists. Former Governor Zhao claimed to be loyal to the Zhili clique, but he has been more than happy to harbour those who'd see the Zhili deposed, and was even willing to let the Kuomintang run in his election. Having no patience for those who defy him, Governor Tang has had his men hunt out these Federalists, these traitors, and has personally overseen their arrests. Unfortunately many of them managed to escape, fleeing to other parts of China, where exactly we know not.\n\nSome of the few among Zhao's old allies who can be trusted are the Xiangxi Diarchy, Tian Yingzhao and Chen Quzhen. With our recent Союз с диархией, and the federalists fleeing from the province, the Governor began another series of talks with Tian in Changsha. The man has a notable amount of the Assembly under his sway, and given he has begun to fully integrate into Tang Xiangming's clique, it only makes logical sense for his Parliamentary group to be merged with Tang Xiangming's Harmony Association, in order to pool resources together and help everyone involved, of course."
 hnn.zhili.13.a: "We have no room for traitors."
  
 hnn.zhili.14.t: "The Iron Heel"
 hnn.zhili.14.d: "One of the most insidious parts of the Kuomintang is their dedication to Socialist ideals, internationalism which would rather see China sold out to self proclaimed \"Anti-Imperialists\" who want nothing more than a second century of humiliation. We cannot let these ideas grow and fester in our province, no matter the cost.\n\nGovernor Tang has spared no expense in rooting out the socialists, with the banning of unions in Hunan, many began to go on strike, but those strikes were quickly broken by our army, forcing workers back into their workplaces. Several ringleaders were captured and thrown into prison, the conditions being rather... grim.\n\nIn response to these sweeping ant-socialist movements from our Governor, the CSP leaders have fled from the province, evading capture by our agents, with the rest of the party disorganised and in shambles. With the heads of the Socialist Hydra cut off, the movement will falter and die out naturally."
 hnn.zhili.14.a: "Traitors and Cowards."
  
 hnn.zhili.15.t: "New Elections?"
 hnn.zhili.15.d: "With Hunan's safety and security finally ensured, the Kuomintang and Socialism vanquished, there have been calls from many to finally end the state of martial law and bring civilian control back to Hunan. Ever the magnanimous ruler, [HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang has listened to these calls, and declared the state of Martial Law to finally be at an end.\n\n[HNN_new_elections_middle_text] With the step away from Authoritarianism, [HNN_tang_xiangming_title] Tang Xiangming has convinced his brother, Tang Hualong, to fully integrate the Chinese Constitutionalist Party into the Harmony Association's coalition. With their combined political might they swept the recently held election, Tang Xiangming's \"Harmony Association\" earning a supermajority in the Provincial Assembly, and swiftly electing Tang Xiangming as the new Civilian Governor of Hunan.\n\nWhile some outside of our province claim the elections to be unfair, there has been little to no reportings of such a thing coming from within the province itself, and as such the claims have been mostly written off by Governor Tang as hearsay. With his \"Democratic\" mandate in hand, Tang Xiangming looks forward to his new term as Hunan's Governor."
 hnn.zhili.15.scpc: "With himself shifting from Military Governor to a Civilian one, he recognises the need for a proper mandate as Governor, and declared elections will be held imminently. He has also stated that he will work with Guangdong and Guangxi to restore civilian control there, and once that is done he shall dissolve his title as Inspector-General of Xiang-Yue-Gui and rule in Hunan alone."
 hnn.zhili.15.hnn: "With himself shifting from Military Governor to a Civilian one, he recognises the need for a proper mandate as Governor, and declared elections will be held imminently."
 hnn.zhili.15.a: "To our \"Civilian\" Governor!"
  
 hnn.zhili.16.t: "Hunan's Commander-in-Chief"
 hnn.zhili.16.d: "With Hunan's safety and security finally ensured, the Kuomintang and Социализм побежден, there have been calls from many to finally end the state of martial law and bring civilian control back to Hunan. Governor Tang Xiangming however, recognises that this is but a false sense of security. Seeing the threats all around him and around Hunan, he has rejected the attempts to convince him towards taking a lighter hand, and stated that the state of martial law will continue until \"absolute safety from foreign threats can be ensured\".\n\nThis hardline stance on the matter has lead to the intellectuals and democrats still willing to work with him to distance themselves from his regime, including his own brother, Tang Hualong. While Tang hasn't resigned from his post, he has made it clear to his younger brother that he and his party see this as a blatant power grab from Governor Tang Xiangming.\n\nGovernor Tang, for his part, spoke with his brother behind closed doors, pleading his case and ensuring that he can still rely on him for support in the upcoming time.\n\nWith his brothers support secured, the Military Governor stated that he would ensure all traitors to Hunan are given swift justice, that his Government would refuse to accept disobedience or disloyalty, and that the safety of every single loyal Hunanese citizen would remain absolute."
 hnn.zhili.16.a: "The Commander-in-Chief brings order, not freedom."
  
 hnn.zhili.17.t: "Formation of the Southwest China Political Council"
 hnn.zhili.17.d: "After a series of negotiations with [HNN_zhili_home_base], Tang Xiangming has declared the formation of the Southwest China Political Council. With approval of [HNN_zhili_home_base], he has been elevated from Governor of Hunan to Inspector-General of Xiang-Yue-Gui (Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi), giving him complete and direct control over the military affairs of, and by extension de facto control over, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi.\n\nWithin Hunan itself, this has led to little changing, however in Guangdong and Guangxi, it means an end to the New Army occupying major cities, and some semblance of normality returning to the two Guang’s.\n\nIn Guangxi, the Inspector-General has decided to cooperate with local Guangxi clans, former members of the Old Guangxi clique, and local warlords, men such as Liu Zhenhuan. All to ensure proper order would be brought to the turbulent and militant Province.\n\nIn Guangdong however, a softer approach was needed, under Chen Jiongming Guangdong has suffered similar issues as Hunan did under Zhao Hengti, however Tang recognizes he cannot take the same approach. He sent Tang Hualong south, to negotiate with the Guangdong Assembly.. Luckily for both men, Tang Hualong could successfully find a compromise with the Province, preying on fears from the Merchant Corps, the Gentry, and other Conservatives. While also using his connections to the CERA to court over moderates and even some on the left. He has successfully negotiated a working coalition in the Assembly, and has returned to Changsha with good news for his younger brother.\n\nWith the two Guang’s under control, Tang Xiangming has secured a powerful southern bloc, and autonomy from [HNN_zhili_home_base]. The Inspector-General has succeeded on the field and off it, and has been rewarded for his efforts and talents."
 hnn.zhili.17.a: "To the Inspector-General of Xiang-Yue-Gui, to Tang Xiangming!"
  
 hnn.zhili.18.t: "Restoring Order to Sichuan"
 hnn.zhili.18.d: "Easily the most fractured Province in China, Tang Xiangming’s conquest of Sichuan has brought a sense of stability to the chaotic Province. It also, however, comes with its own problems. Not wishing to enter the quagmire that is Sichuan’s political thunderdome himself, he needed to find a proper Governor for the Province.\n\nAs he gathered more information about the Province and its situation on the ground, he could feel a headache coming in, trying to find a worthwhile candidate that fit his criteria. Eventually however, he found one.\n\nTian Songyao, a minor warlord in Sichuan, a kingmaker in the Province, and an ally of the Zhili clique. lf. He’s a committed anti-socialist who has served China faithfully. Forming early ties with the Zhili clique, Tian has been a player on Sichuan’s stage since the days of Yuan Shikai, and as such he knows the Province’s politics better than any outside his Province could know them. He is a natural fit as Governor of Sichuan, and an excellent choice by the Inspector-General.\n\nSending a telegram to the man, and to Beijing, Inspector-General Tang allowed him to move into the lands the New Army was occupying, giving him a strong power base to keep the other Sichuan warlords, the ones that survived, in check."
 hnn.zhili.18.a: "Order has finally been restored to Chengdu."
  
 hnn.zhili.19.t: "Taming the Republican Stronghold"
 hnn.zhili.19.d: "One of the most turbulent and tumultuous Provinces, Yunnan has finally been brought to heel by Inspector-General Tang Xiangming.\n\nEver since Cai E declared independence in the wake of Yuan Shikai crowning himself Emperor, Yunnan has traditionally been distant, if not outright hostile, towards the central Government in China. The National Protection Alliance, the Constitutional Protection Movement, Yunnan has prided itself on its stubborn and resilient nature. Pride comes before the fall however, and Yunnan has fallen to our forces.\n\nLuckily for Tang, Yunnan’s political scene was quick to grasp, and he quickly found that General Hu Ruyou, a man who respects the central authority of China, was a perfect candidate for Governor of Yunnan. Second only to Long Yun, and a native of Yunnan, he knows his home well, and will certainly be able to use his forces to quell the unrest within it.\n\nSending a Telegram to the man, and to [HNN_zhili_home_base] of course, Tang Xiangming has informed him of his promotion to Governor, and gotten assurances that he will restore order to the Province as soon as possible."

He is, quite naturally, joined by Governor Yuan Zuming, finally returning to the city after far too long. It was the first time he had control over the city, and all of Guizhou, since 1921.\n\n[HNN_reclamation_of_guizhou_end_text]"
 hnn.zhili.20.alliance: "It was the first time the two had spoken since observing their armies drills on the border. It was then that Tang Xiangming stated that he would do everything in his power to restore the control of Guizhou to the proper authorities, and today he has proven his word true. It’s clear to all that the reclamation of Guizhou would mark a bright day in both their alliance, and in the history of China itself."
 hnn.zhili.20.no.alliance: "Only briefly speaking once, when Tang took over Changsha and became Hunan’s new Governor, Yuan was uncertain how things would change with the new regime. The reunification of Guizhou was quite the pleasant surprise for a man. He spoke with Tang Xiangming briefly, saying that right now he needed to focus on reincorporating the rest of Guizhou with his clique, but saying that the two should speak again soon, perhaps during a joint drilling session between their Armies."
 hnn.zhili.20.a: "Guizhou, divided for so long, is finally reunited."
  
 #Kuomintang events 
 hnn.kmt.1.t: "A Resounding Electoral Success"
 hnn.kmt.1.d: "In a surprise to everyone, the Kuomintang's united ticket has been declared victorious over Zhao Hengti's People's Renewal Society, and the other minor liberal parties. Considered the underdogs entering into the race, the duo managed to sway the hearts and minds of Hunan's populace, with Tang undeniably winning the votes of the workers, whilst Cheng managed to sway the more moderate voters, sceptical of Tang's radical worker action.\n\nWhilst the election did see an increase in political violence on behalf of the Kuomintang, the duo has entered the provincial assembly as champions. With [HNN_kmt_leader] having been sworn in as Provincial Governor, and [HNN_kmt_sic] as his Speaker of the Assembly, they have rapidly filled their cabinet with their Kuomintang comrades. Notably, Huang Gonglue from the Eighth, and Qin Zhen, aligned with Cheng Qian, albeit not from within the Sixth Army.\n\nHowever, not everyone within the region agrees with the election development. Tang Xiangming, commander of the garrison in Yueyang and the Zhili attaché to Hunan, has proven himself mysteriously unreceptive towards telegrams from the Central Government. Likewise, in the east and west, Zhao's despotic warlord partners Yuan Zuming, and the diarchy of Tian Yingzhao and Chen Quzhen, have similarly refused to respond to any telegrams from the Provincial Government. Leading military figures, mainly He Jian and Song Xilian, have advised their respective commanders that the Beiyang warlords may be plotting an overthrow of the revolutionary government and that the Kuomintang should act first."

 hnn.kmt.2.d: "With the resounding rout of Tang \"The Butcher\" Xiangming, and the complete abrogation of any ties that the previous Hunan administrations had to the Zhili clique, the Kuomintang's United Front has seen off the storm of chaos, and can now finally focus on bringing the National Revolution to the Hunanese people. Ultimately, as the hesitation of Hunan's Provincial Army units shows, it is necessary for the Kuomintang and Kuomintang alone to lead Hunan to a bright future, for without the valiant efforts of the Sixth and Eighth armies, Hunan very well would've been plunged into another era of darkness under the tyranny of Tang Xiangming.\n\nHowever, the work is never over for the Kuomintang United Front, as in the West and Eastern portion of Guizhou, lies the next two threats to the Kuomintang's rule. With the Diarchy of Tian Yingzhao and Chen Quzhen  held up in Xiangxi — having long cooperated with Zhao — and the Old Guizhou clique entrenched within Eastern Guizhou — also a cooperative ally of Zhao — it is clear that the United Front's combined strength will be necessary to uproot both threats.\n\nYet they are not alone, for whilst their rule may be secured, they cannot win the hearts of the Provincial Assembly. That is however, where Tan Yankai comes into play. The ex-commander of the Kuomintang's 2nd Army and a previous governor of Hunan, Tan led his forces valiantly into Hunan during the Northern Expedition, but ultimately surrendered to Zhao in exchange for amnesty. Having ran in the recent election, Tan has opted to revive his military formation, recruiting the likes of the Lu brothers, amongst others, to his cause in being a rallying point for the remaining moderate republicans within Hunan.\n\nWith personal abhorrence for both Cheng and Tang due to previous actions against his Governorship in the past, Tan nonetheless has offered a hand in assistance, if not for the Kuomintang, then for the Republican movement as a whole."

 hnn.kmt.3.t: "An Abrupt End"
 hnn.kmt.3.d: "With the men largely functioning autonomously from each other, Cheng Qian has been hard at work focusing on eradicating Hunan's endemic warlords, and local bandits, intent on providing safety and security for the Hunanese people under the Kuomintang's auspices. In the meantime, Tang Shengzhi and Tan Yankai have been handling the general administration of the provincial government, with Tan utilising his assemblyman status, and Tang his connections with the citizenry, to ensure a return to normalcy even after a chaotic election cycle, and calamitous coup attempt by Tang Xiangming.\n\nHowever, utilising his new powers installed in him by the provincial constitution, Tang recently called for an emergency Provincial Assembly meeting, with enforced participation. When the various assemblymen of all stripes and colours filled into their seats, the crowds of elites, republicans and federalists ultimately noted the lacking presence of Tan Yankai's clique, or that of Huang Yanpei, or even Zhou Shizhao and Qian Yongming. Nonetheless, Tang Shengzhi opened the meeting with the immediate announcement that the Provincial Assembly was hereby abolished, the Constitution declared null and void, and that the Kuomintang wil promulgate the installation of a new revolutionary party state intent on following the stages of the National Revolution to its most basic principles. When the ruckus and turmoil of the assembly had calmed, Tang followed by indicting all present assemblymen on charges of \"revolutionary treason\", ordering his men to begin arrests immediately.\n\nUpon hearing the fallout of the assembly's abolition from his aide-de-camp, Cheng Qian immediately telegrammed the capital for a response, but heard no answer, instead receiving one in reply from now ex-assemblyman Tan Yankai, dissuading the general from any attempts to talk sense into Tang, and for his impotent foolishness to not see that this was coming. Having taken matters into his own hands, Tan managed to evacuate a series of key republicans from the assembly, so that they will not be imprisoned by members of the Eighth Army."

 hnn.kmt.3.b: "Are you so bereft of good sense?"
  
 hnn.kmt.4.t: "Traitor's Due"
 hnn.kmt.4.d: "Following the announcement of their campaign to eradicate the warlords remaining within Hunan, generals Cheng Qian and Tang Shengzhi agreed on a simultaneous, two-pronged strike against Yuan Zuming holed up in Guizhou, and the Diarchy within western Hunan. With Cheng tackling the Diarchy, the old general opted for a series of devastating artillery bombardments, expertly aimed to precisely shatter the morale of the warlord forces, before allowing Song Xilian's division to engage in a thorough encirclement of Xiangxi. Despite putting up a valiant defence of their own, the warlord forces led directly by Tian Yingzhao began to crumble first, owed to the warlord's perpetual stupor, and with his best efforts notwithstanding, Chen Quzhen's forces were unable to reverse the situation. With their final efforts to engage in a breakout operation to escape into Sichuan territory ending in dramatic failure, the Diarchy surrendered to the advancing Sixth Army.\n\nIn the Eastern Guizhou front, Tang Shengzhi's 8th Army instituted a campaign of heavy reconnaissance, aided by irregular guerrilla units situated within Guizhou, before advancing upon Yuan Zuming's entrenched Old Guizhou clique. Nominally expecting any confrontation to come from within Yunnan, Yuan Zuming's defences on his Eastern flank were comparatively light, which allowed the 8th Army to engage in steady advances despite rigorous fighting from the devoutly loyal Old Guizhou clique. However, through the clever assistance of ex-Guizhou clique member Wang Tianpei, who provided invaluable connections and knowledge on Yuan Zuming's critical weakpoints, enabling the Eighth Army to win a resounding victory with minimal losses.\n\nWith the ultimate capture of Yuan by He Jian's 2nd Division, the warlord was turned over to Tang, and Kuomintang loyalist Lu Dao was installed as Guizhou Chairman. With the intention to be transported to Changsha for a similar punishment as the Diarchy, reports have emerged in Changsha that Yuan has reportedly died in custody. Such news immediately aroused suspicion within Tan Yankai, who was overseeing the provincial government whilst the generals were away, accusing Tang of having executed Yuan in private for his betrayal in the Northern Expedition. Similarly, Cheng Qian has also reprimanded Tang for acting so ruthlessly, and without consideration of the other's within the government."

 hnn.kmt.4.b: "Revenge is a fool's bargain."
  
 hnn.kmt.5.t: "Ruptures in the \"United\" Front"
 hnn.kmt.5.d: "In the culmination of all efforts, lies the enduring fear of failure. This feeling is all too persistent in the mind of Cheng Qian as of recent. Originally seeing the alliance with Tang Shengzhi and his Left Kuomintang Eighth Army as a way of witnessing the first step towards party reconciliation, such dreams have been torn down by the brutal claws of reality. Despite his efforts, Tan Yankai of the revived 2nd Army intended to keep the disparaging individuals together — despite despising both Cheng and Tang equally — trying his best to mediate between the Sixth and Eighth armies, to no avail. Both prove nigh irreconcilable, and liable to tear the movement apart.\n\nYet amongst Tang's critical Eighth Army commanders lies a black sheep. Not espousing the peasant focused socialism of the likes of He Long or Peng Dehuai. Herein lies He Jian, and his loyal deputy Liu Jianxu. Conflicted in his loyalties to Tang, having served him since the 1920s, the recent radical actions by his superior has lead to a great personal introspection for the general. Crucial in so many successes, yet liable in the rising masses of radicalism within his province. Similarly, He has long resented having to constantly dwell within the shadow of Tang Shengzhi, Peng Dehuai and He Long.\n\nHaving held his private disposition for too long however, he has sent a petition to Cheng Qian for his 8th Army's 2nd Division to be folded into the 6th Army, transferring all men and material to the 6th, in return, He desires a promotion not just for himself, but for Liu Jianxu too. Long weighing the benefits of such a risky move, inevitably prone to inflaming further tensions with the Eight, Cheng has ultimately relented to He's petition, and going even a step further.\n\nWith the convening of the emergency congress, Cheng Qian announced a series of promotions, namely for He, Liu and Li Minghao, alongside the establishment of the new Rural Pacification and Peace Preservation offices, in order to better promote coordination between local forces and regular armies, as well as tackling the endemic militia problem.\n\nA surprise to many, but especially to Tang Shengzhi, the general then announced a series of his own promotions of his own devoutly loyal men towards positions within the Provincial Army, namely those of Liu Xing, Gong Hao and Tao Guang, in an attempt to equalise the playing field. Despite their best efforts, it would appear the United Front has fallen, and only one survivor can emerge..."
 hnn.kmt.5.a: "A Fourth player emerges."
  
 hnn.kmt.6.t: "Tackling the Local Militias"
 hnn.kmt.6.d: "Nominally a local organisation, the militia in Hunan were intended to serve as local guardians for their communities in times of great national crisis, and yet it did not turn out that way. Generally seen as being controlled by the local elites and serving their interests exclusively, many local militia commanders are not only extensively corrupt, but use and abuse the military power granted to them by the provincial government to interfere in local governance and the administration of local, honest, justice. Furthermore, the quality of local militia vary wildly from county to county, and the extensive autonomy of militia commanders hinders any combined operations.\n\nIn what is being claimed as his hallmark reform proposition, He Jian has drafted a concerted reform effort aimed at distinguishing between two types of militia: standing forces of armed regulars and mass militia composed of ordinary citizens. The first reform would seek to establish stronger official control by organising all local militia, now designated Household Conscription Militia, under a unified bureau headed by the county magistrate and assisted by vice-heads selected from among the local elite. All full time militia units were to be reorganised into standardised standing companies, meanwhile, one in every three adult males under the age of forty would be required to participate in unpaid mass militia units, termed \"watch patrols\". By selecting men from watch patrols to serve three-year terms in standing companies, the hope is that a close connection between the two types of militia will be formed.\n\nWhat remains up to question however, is the intent and purpose behind the standing companies. Whilst they do not serve the inherent role of local defence akin to the watch patrols, they nonetheless can be utilised against enemies of the state apparatus. Eighth Army commander Tang Shengzhi advocates for the pointing of militia efforts to those he dubiously dubs \"enemies of the people\", whilst Sixth Army commander Cheng Qian insists that the militia be directed at local bandits and the remaining petty warlords that survived the Kuomintang's early operations."
 hnn.kmt.6.a: "Direct our efforts against the enemies of the people!"
 hnn.kmt.6.b: "Focus on the bandits, and petty warlords, that remain."
  
 hnn.kmt.7.t: "Formation of the Peace Preservation Corps"
 hnn.kmt.7.d: "In light of our recent grand reform efforts aimed at tackling the local militia problem, it would appear that the previous system instituted by General He Jian and his Peace Preservation office has led to results not in line with the expectations desired by either the government or He himself. For example, most magistrates are too busy to actually tend to the management of the local militia corps, and therefore it would fall onto the vice-heads to run them. As many vice-heads were in-fact ex-local militia commanders, the same behaviours of abuse tended to crop up. Similarly, localities were slow to implement the watch patrol system, and lacking such critical foundation, led to the legalisation of what were effectively mercenary companies.\n\nIn response, He Jian has proposed another major reform focused on transforming the very nature of the standing companies. Firstly, all standing companies shall be reformed and consolidated into a singular county \"Peace Preservation\" regiment, and these forces will receive training similar to the regular army. The country magistrate supervisory role will be eliminated, and instead Peace Preservation units will be placed under officers who are selected on the basis of prior experience in the military, appointed by the Rural Pacification Commander, He Jian.\n\nHowever Tang Shengzhi, He Long and Peng Dehuai have all raised concerns with He Jian's overt anti-socialist outlook. Knowing the general for decades, Tang has raised He's private beliefs of devout anti-socialism towards the congress, accusing He of proliferating his own private army of legal thugs to dispense his so-called \"pacification\" on the poor citizenry who only desire a better world for themselves. Such accusations have been deflected by He, who insists that his goal is to militarise the Hunanese people, so that they may stand ready for if, or when, an invader sets foot on the province's territory."
 hnn.kmt.7.a: "This is an affront to the Party itself!"
 hnn.kmt.7.b: "Restrain some of the worst parts."
  
 hnn.kmt.8.t: "Financing the Education Efforts"
 hnn.kmt.8.d: "Of special interest to both He Jian and Cheng Qian is that of the education department. With Cheng Qian having educated many future Kuomintang rising stars such as Song Xilian, whilst He Jian descends from a family with a background in education, it is natural both men bond over their fondness for enlightening the youth. As such, the duo have proposed an ambitious plan that would expand primary schools in Hunan from 18,000 to 23,800. At the same time, they desire the expansion of middle school enrolments across junior Hunanese, and the establishment of normal schools in each county, the creation of a system of exams for elementary and secondary school teachers to improve the quality of instruction, the establishment of a selection process and the provision of public funding for students wishing to study abroad. Finally, the duo desire the founding of short-term elementary schools and scholarship programmes for the children of poor families, and the organisation of a province wide literacy campaign.\n\nReceiving resounding agreement from all members of government, and crucially Tan Yankai alongside Tang Shengzhi, the true issue up for debate was where the provincial government should procure the necessary funds for such an ambitious project. With He Jian insisting that at least one-quarter of the provincial budget be dedicated to the purpose of the programmes, Tang Shengzhi has fought back. Raising the issue that even already, expense payments for government offices are often delayed, and troop payments are frequently in arrears, Tang proposes that its necessary for the government to perform budget cuts in order to institute such a landmark programme.\n\nWith such an idea again in mutual agreement, Tang has advocated for the allocation of funds away from General He Jian's Rural Pacification and Peace Preservation Offices, insisting that the bodies should be subservient to the military, not have the funding to be able to perform independently from it. In opposition, He Jian suggests that government move funding away from its union support programmes, insisting that workers already receive ample aid from the government directly, and that funding the unions is sure to lead to the expanding influence of the Chinese Syndicalist Party."
 hnn.kmt.8.a: "Move to allocate funds away from the Pacification Office."
 hnn.kmt.8.b: "Regretfully, deprive funds from the Unions."
  
 hnn.kmt.9.t: "Out with the Old, In with the New"
 hnn.kmt.9.d: "The next reform being hotly debated within the provincial government is that of the local governmental administration reforms proposed by general He Jian. In said reforms, the General advocates for the expansion and restructuring of local administrations, promoting the development of examination and evaluation systems for country magistrates, alongside the expansion and elaboration of county government. Similarly, He desires for the government to undertake the reorganisation and regularisation of sub-county government — perhaps reinforced by the generals recurring efforts, with varying degrees of success, for the institution of a baojia mutual security system — and for the implementation of a system of periodic inspections, in order to evaluate the responsiveness of local officials, and their effectiveness in implementing government policies.\n\nIn particular however, that last section of the reform has provoked ire from Tang Shengzhi, who instead proposes that local officials be evaluating not on effectiveness, albeit important, but instead on their loyalty to the party. Tang draws special attention to the significance of previous Hunan administrations, wherein local elites and gentry began to control the magistrates of their country districts through bribes or other nefarious means. By insisting on party loyalty, Hunan's new administration can rectify the issues of the past, whilst walking towards the future."
 hnn.kmt.9.a: "Party loyalty to the utmost!"
 hnn.kmt.9.b: "Appoint magistrates based on merit, not ideology."
  
 hnn.kmt.10.t: "The Extent of Provisional Action"
 hnn.kmt.10.d: "In another one of General He Jian's hallmark reform efforts, he has advised that the provincial government begin the creation of a series of advisory committees, the establishment of a series of regulations, and the formation of future plans for the fulfilment of Hunan's National Revolution. Insisting that the province is woefully unprepared to embark on Tutelage, let alone military rule or National Reconstruction, He insists that the regulations in Hunan will serve as guides to future actions, as opposed to being written in the place of action.\n\nUltimately, the Sixth Army is in agreement with General He, with Cheng Qian himself recognising the benefit provided by creating an increasingly institutionalised regulatory regime linked to the broader state-building effort of the Kuomintang as a whole. Similarly, He has continued his campaign, insisting that laws and regulations are an essential foundation for any action, and presents not only the writing of said regulations but also their dissemination as an important function of government.\n\nIn complete opposition to such action stands Tang Shengzhi and his Eighth Army, insisting that the continued bureaucratisation of the party's organs and functions will only lead to an unnecessary quagmire of nightmares, that would have to be traversed for any considerable action to be implemented. Instead, the General advocates for a policy of brief planning, but immediate corresponding action. Necessitating that revolutionary governance is an ugly affair, and that any further writings will lead to an ineffectual government akin to those in Beiyang."
 hnn.kmt.10.a: "Plans mean nothing without corresponding action!"
 hnn.kmt.10.b: "Governance is not in the amount of words, but in implementation."
  
 hnn.kmt.11.t: "Building the Foundations"
 hnn.kmt.11.d: "As advised by General He Jian, the government has embarked on a grand expansion of Hunan's transportation and communication systems. Focusing on motor transport, the ultimate aim for the government's project is to expand Hunan's highways from 1000 miles of road to the upper limits of 4000. As noted by He, such an expansion of critical infrastructure would mean any intrepid individual could drive motorised vehicles from within Hunan, to all of its neighbouring provinces. Likewise, in railroad construction, the government aims for the enhancement of the pre-existing Guangzhou-Beijing line to enable further trainlines to travel alongside it.\n\nIn terms of telecommunications, Hunan's Construction Department hopes to expand the measly number of 90 miles of telecom cables to 2800 miles, totalling 15 lines across 33 of Hunan's 75 counties. Naturally, whilst the civilians are expected to receive some benefit from the projects, the true enhancements arise in the cases of military transportation and coordination.\n\nHowever, Tang Shengzhi has criticised the government for wasting provincial resources on projects that contribute in no large number to needs and wants of the Chinese citizenry. Pointing out that the construction of roads provides little benefits to farmers, who lack access to such vehicles, and instead is a sign of the Provincial Government and Sixth Army engorging themselves on their own profits."
 hnn.kmt.11.a: "Yet these efforts fail to reach those who need them the most."
 hnn.kmt.11.b: "A fantastic initiative, He Jian!"
  
 hnn.kmt.12.t: "Hunan's Revolutionary Savant"
 hnn.kmt.12.d: "When Tang Shengzhi first betrayed Zhao on the eve of the Northern Expedition, he knew little of how his reverberating power play would begin to shape and shift his life from there onwards. Perhaps if he had stayed under Zhao's command, he would've accompanied the likes of Ye Kaixin, or He Yaozu as Zhao's trusted lieutenants, and perhaps he would've won the Governorship by challenging the incumbent in a fair match. Yet ultimately, would he have been satisfied? Would he have sat by as Zhao clamped down on the labour movement, cooperated with despots, and oppressed the workers? All in the name of defending Hunan's democracy?\n\nReflecting on his actions, and his connection to the world, it has become increasingly clear to the general as to why the Xinhai Revolution failed in 1911. Critical to its misfortunes, was not its lack of arms, or skilled personnel, but of its lack of participation of the workers and peasants. The success of the revolution, be it the Kuomintang's National Revolution or otherwise, hinged on the support and mass uprising of both the workers and peasants. The nascent May 30th movement has proved this fact, and similarly, the 1932 Uprisings throughout the country reinforced it.\n\nHaving outflanked his political rival, Cheng Qian, the intrepid general called for a second congress within the Hunan Provincial Government, wherein he announced the removal of all Sixth Army members from their government offices post-haste, the abolition of the Rural Pacification and Peace Preservation offices, and the appointment of He Long to the previous offices held by Cheng, along with instating other Eighth Army commanders into the suddenly vacant positions.\n\nYet, Tang could not bring himself to strip anyone from the 6th Army of their party membership, perhaps out of respect for their shared sacrifices for the nation, or otherwise. In a striking display of compassion, at least to outsiders, Tang has extended a hand of thanks to his rivals, hoping that together they may very well work to protect the Hunanese people no matter the cost."
 hnn.kmt.12.a: "Finally, on top."
  
 hnn.kmt.13.t: "Ruminations of the Old Guard"
 hnn.kmt.13.d: "Weathered and beaten, yet stubborn and resistant. No finer words could exemplify Cheng Qian's continued revolutionary struggle for the Chinese people. Considered a relic of a bygone age by the young radicals across the aisle, Cheng nonetheless provides a steady hand at the wheel of Hunan's future. Whilst he very well may have lit the flame of infighting that has seen so much chaos and bloodshed in the short lifetime of Hunan's Provincial Government, he remains resolute that it was the correct choice.\n\nWith the careful politicking of the old general outmanoeuvring Tang Shengzhi's radical onslaught, the Chairman called for a second congress within the Hunanese Provincial Government, wherein he announced the removal of Tang Shengzhi and the Eighth Army from all governmental offices, and the thorough deradicalisation of government. With a resolute mind, the Chairman appointed ringleader of Hunan's recent reforms, and head of the Peace Preservation office, He Jian, to fulfil the obligations and duties of Tang Shengzhi's previous role within government.\n\nDespite all of the injustices committed, and what could be considered treason by many within the party, the old general opted not to implement any form of capital punishment upon Tang, nor strip him of party membership. Extending a hand of compromise, like always, the General hopes that Tang will redeem himself through service to the nation and its National Revolution.\n\nNonetheless, behind closed doors, the old general has still ordered the Public Safety Bureau to maintain tabs on all actions committed by Tang and his two deputies, Peng Dehuai and He Long. For whilst he hopes for their earnest redemption, he has learnt the consequences of foolishness. Now all that remains is to look forward, to a brighter future for the Chinese nation."
 hnn.kmt.13.a: "Our comrades' dream lives on."
  
 hnn.kmt.14.t: "Our Allies in Hunan"
 hnn.kmt.14.d1: "[ROOT.GetLeader] has received a recent telegram of supposed support from Provincial Chairman [HNN.GetLeader], reaffirming his ties with our Federal Government. Considering the fact that [HNN.GetLeader] has quite recently ousted our genuine Federalist and close ally Zhao Hengti for the second time, it is natural that many within the government view [HNN.GetLeader] with a strong sense of estrangement. Even worse, [HNN.GetLeader]'s original ousting of Zhao led to the cataclysmic Northern Expedition.\n\nYet Revolutionary actions make for strange bedfellows, and [ROOT.GetLeader] is no stranger to compromises with unscrupulous opportunists to see the general achievement of a Federal China. With [HNN.GetLeader]'s original backers in the Kuomintang experiencing defeat across the board, he had turned towards [ROOT.GetLeader], who graciously accepted his alliance, despite Zhao's protests.\n\nUltimately however, no matter how idealistic, [HNN.GetLeader] without a doubt has to contend with the might of his greatest ally, and rival, in the forces of [HNN.GetSecondInCommand], who is absolutely against the ideology of our government. Relentlessly fighting [HNN.GetLeader] at every step of the way. Fortunately, [HNN.GetLeader] reassures [ROOT.GetLeader] that his position in Hunan's provincial government is absolutely secure."
 hnn.kmt.14.d2: "Despite the stringent party line advocated for by the Reorganised Comrades Association, the Hunanese Kuomintang laugh in the face of such ideals and orthodoxy. Ruled by a diarchy of Tang Shengzhi's 8th Army and Cheng Qian's 6th Army, the duo outwardly project a cross-wing United Kuomintang Front. Yet our eyes and ears in the underground assure us that the unity presented is but merely a facade. Underneath the shine and gleam is a provincial government rife with infighting and intrigue.\n\nPerhaps, in an odd way, it is emblematic of our own internal power struggles. Nonetheless, both of the Hunanese leaders are firm advocates against the Reorganised Comrades Association, with Tang Shengzhi being one of the key generals of the Provisional Action Committee during MinGan, whilst Cheng Qian is a staunch believer in the moderate stance preached by Sun Fo's Reconstruction Faction.\n\nYet one would be a fool to not acknowledge the great strides and successes being made within the Provincial Government. For Hunan has displayed a remarkable capability of participating in, if imperfect, democracy. Whilst ultimately it will have to wait until the conclusion of the National Revolution, the province is serving as a key model province for the rest of the nation."
 hnn.kmt.14.d3: "In an excellent display of his strategic mind, Cheng Qian has managed to successfully facilitate the removal of one of the Kuomintang's rivals, Zhao Hengti. Yet curiously, the commander of the 6th Army achieved this through a unified effort with Left Kuomintang radical, and commander of the 8th Army, Tang Shengzhi. Both generals entered Hunan province upon the announcement of Hunan's provincial election, and elected to cooperate together on a joint Kuomintang ticket.\n\nWhilst idealists would dream of this being a sign of reunification of the wings of the party, it has clearly exemplified the opposite. Even now, both Cheng and Tang squabble, fight, and commit espionage against each other to try and oust the other individual from their position of power within the province.\n\nConsidering the circumstances, it is absolutely necessary that Cheng Qian comes out the victor, however we cannot spare the resources to openly support his efforts. Yet [ROOT.GetLeader] can clearly see that despite the infighting, Hunan is making great strides towards setting the example as a Kuomintang model province, well on its way towards the proliferation of the National Revolution."
 hnn.kmt.14.d4: "An odd duck amongst the fellows of the National Protection Alliance, Provincial \"Chairman\" [HNN.GetLeader] has sent an elaborate series of telegrams to [ROOT.GetLeader], assuring the leader of his, and Hunan's, continued and perpetual support for the National Protection Alliance. A revolutionary in spirit and action, the Chairman has found himself amongst those who would usually disagree with his governance, yet nonetheless he fights by their side.\n\nDespite the venerable Chairman's allies however, Hunan itself remains a hotbed of revolutionary fervour, with a strong workers movement, and even stronger peasant foundation. Perhaps, in light of the situation in the nation, the Kuomintang will last even upon reunification by the NPA.\n\nUltimately however, no matter how idealistic, [HNN.GetLeader] without a doubt has to contend with his more orthodox Kuomintang allies that he shares power with. As while [HNN.GetLeader] reaffirms his commitment, his deputy and greatest rival [HNN.GetSecondInCommand] is absolutely no friend of ours, and will relentlessly fight to oppose us at every direction. Unfortunately, all [ROOT.GetLeader] can do is hope that [HNN.GetLeader] can wrangle his radicals, and maintain control."

With his ambitions drawing him from the slow advancement of a scholar's career, to the skyrocketing rapid promotions capable within China's new modern style armies. He Jian is a veteran of many conflicts, all requiring his capable mind and quick thinking skills to ensure survival. Having rode the coattails of Tang Shengzhi's own career, following him in promotion all the way to brigade commander, He Jian began to emerge himself following the Northern Expedition and his time in MinGan. Having perhaps reached the zenith of his career following his promotion to division commander and head of the Rural Pacification Office, He might not be the most loyal or ideologically stringent, but his achievements alone speak for themselves."
 hnn.kmt.15.d.song: "Emblematic of the Whampoa generation of cadres, Song Xilian is a fresh, young face within the National Revolutionary Army. Inclined to revolutionary behaviour from a young age, at the age of 13, he and his classmates co-founded a revolutionary paper, most infamously known for criticising Zhao Hengti upon his execution of labour activists during his tenure. Having graduated from the first class of Whampoa, Song became the youngest graduate in the history of the academy, and thundered onto the battlefield with valiant performance in the Eastern and Northern expeditions. Ultimately however, his true career is yet to begin, and whilst lauded as one of the Kuomintang's greatest officers, he has focused on taking a mostly apolitical moderate stance within inter-party politics, albeit private allegiances seem to lie with his old superior, Cheng Qian."
 hnn.kmt.15.d.cheng: "Having been fighting the revolutionary struggle for decades, Cheng Qian's career has witnessed many ups and downs, yet he has never truly been defeated. Seeing service in Xinhai, the Northern Expedition, and everything in-between, he is symbolic of the old diehard Tongmenghui revolutionaries, a generation long past. Considered a moderate by many of his contemporaries within both the Right and Left wings of the Kuomintang, Cheng echoes the footsteps of Song Jiaoren, or Huang Xing, more than those of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Nonetheless, the old tiger has fought alongside the likes of the late Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and General Li Jishen, always with the hope of seeing the National Revolution. With his recent successes on the battlefield, Cheng has managed to win the hearts of the people for his prized Sixth Army."
 hnn.kmt.15.d.peng: "Born into a family with a long running tradition of farming, his family was within a rapid decline, forcing Peng to make numerous sacrifices to aid their survival. Ultimately participating in a peasant uprising, Peng was forced to flee his family, and later enlisted into Tang Xiangming's army in 1916. This would begin a storied revolutionary career that would see Peng eternally fight for the rights of his fellow peasants. Taking a particular liking towards military command, Peng's skill on the battlefield has continued to rise ever since, leading to his eventual promotion to division commander during his time in MinGan. Regarded as the second pillar of the Eighth Army, alongside the likes of He Long, the duo continue to push an agrarian socialist doctrine under the auspices of their superior Tang Shengzhi, despite his rather more moderate outlook."
 hnn.kmt.15.d.helong: "With his father having been a member of the Gelaohui, and a Qing military officer, perhaps it was fate that He Long too would take the path of the military and revolutionary politics. Following a multipolar career that saw He flirt with socialism, an assassination attempt against Tan Yankai, and an eventual routing by Zhao Hengti, He would join the National Revolutionary Army, and serve with distinction. Following their defeat in the Northern Expedition, He would follow the Eighth Army into the insurgency zone, where he would begin to be courted by many individuals within the Provisional Action Committee. Cementing his agrarian socialist views during his time there, He's military successes serve as a venue for which he can promote the ideals and support for his radical faction within the 8th Army. How much he can influence the policies of his superior Tang Shengzhi however, remains to be seen."
 hnn.kmt.15.d.tang: "Considered by many to be a traitor, an opportunist, a sign of how far the Kuomintang has fallen, none however, can deny Tang Shengzhi's revolutionary credentials. Having joined the Tongmenghui in 1909, Tang would fight in a student corps during the Xinhai Revolution, under the auspices of Zhao Hengti in 1923, and later, against Zhao himself in 1926. Joining the National Revolutionary Army and being given command of the 8th Army that same year, Tang would light the match that would ultimately develop into the inferno of the Northern Expedition, seeing a series of early successes in the first period of the conflict. Witnessing a myriad of men fighting for power and profit within Hunan, Tang would undergo a period of depression, until meeting Buddhist practitioner Gu Boxu, wherein he would convert following his teachings. Whilst his political opponents implore to paint him as a religious fanatic, Tang has taken proudly to their moniker of the \"Buddhist General\"."

 hnn.kmt.16.d: "Admittedly, a radical revolution necessitates radical action, however, such action is capable of toppling the very supports upon which the state is built. The Eighth Army are not anarchists of course, and even they can see the value in maintaining at least cordial ties with their opposition. Through their accruing of power all across the organs of government, they have managed to shuffle the Sixth Army into nigh irrelevancy.\n\nThis totality of control has swept itself up into a massed torrent, resulting in all opposition to Tang being drowned out by the 8th's propaganda department, yet this has put forward the concern that such dominance will lead to eventual weakness. With the 8th Army radicals growing increasingly pompous, they have begun to even push the moderates of the Army around.\n\nThe Sixth Army may be down, but they are not out of the game just yet. Perhaps through our connections and mutual brotherhood, Tang can open avenues for the Sixth to fight back, at least in part, against the radicals within his camp. It would be a wise choice, for the very state of Hunan is at stake."

 hnn.kmt.17.d: "Whilst the Sixth Army promotes itself as a shield of moderatism against the perceived tyranny of the Eighth, our actions of \"defence\" can equally protect the people as it can snuff out their cries. Ultimately, the Sixth's successes on the political battlefield have led to a nigh total dominance of their ranks within the government, with all loyalists of Tang Shengzhi, or the Chinese Syndicalist Party, having their influence isolated.\n\nConsidered a price that we have to pay for salvation, the Sixth Army's appointments and officers have grown increasingly complacent in their solid foundations, losing the vigilance that earned them their might. In a related course of events, the Rural Pacification and Peace Preservation offices have grown increasingly ambitious and bold, no longer deigning it worth the effort to hide their blatant anti-socialist abuses.\n\nConcerned for the stability and prosperity of Hunan as a whole, Cheng could reach out to Tang in a form of affair accompli, to even the scales and allow the Eighth to fight back. It presents itself as an enticing opportunity, lest Hunan break into full civil war."

 hnn.kmt.18.t: "Pomp and Circumstance"
 hnn.kmt.18.d: "The Kuomintang is no stranger to grand displays of military frivolity, be it through parades, or the embellishment of divisions or soldiers with medals and accomplishments. Similarly, the Sixth and Eighth National Revolutionary Armies were inspected by both Chairman [HNN.GetLeader] and [HNN.GetSecondInCommand]. Nominally as a projection of the Kuomintang's military force for all to observe, officials within the government believe that the grand display is an attempt to promote the superiority of either Kuomintang leader's respective army.\n\n A crowd of 15,000 gathered to witness the finest soldiers of the 6th and 8th on their respective marches. The first up for presentation was Cheng Qian's 6th, lead by their shining star, Song Xilian. Emblematic of the force of the Right Kuomintang, the soldiers were clearly weathered and adorned their standard Kuomintang uniform with pride. Marching in unison with each other and the bellowing music, resolute purpose beamed from the soldier's faces.\n\nIn contrast, Tang Shengzhi's 8th Army represented a mixture of Irregular Units, Regular Units, and Tang's own elite veterans. However, perhaps due to their commander's special fixation on the presentation of his army, their uniforms were untarnished by conflict, clearly having been produced with the sole purpose of being used for parade.\n\nMost curiously however, is the adornment upon Tang's elite soldiers. All of them sported the \"Medal of Great Benevolence and Humanity's Redemption\", a clear sign of Tang's Buddhist influences within his soldiers. In fact, Tang's elite soldiers are from a time wherein all forces under the commander had to follow Buddhism, willing or not, in order to serve underneath him. With the parade concluding, little knew what to think of the image Tang crafted: an eclectic mix of devout Buddhist warriors, combined with the standard soldiery of the NRA."
 hnn.kmt.18.a: "Pride of the National Revolutionary Army!"
 hnn.kmt.18.b: "He's indoctrinated our comrades too?"
  
 hnn.kmt.19.t: "Reflections"
 hnn.kmt.19.d: "Through the constant fighting, one finds little time for peace and quiet, even worse if one has not been exiled from their own home province for nearly a decade. The Kuomintang is an organisation of revolutionaries, young, radical and demanding change. Yet in its roots lay a quieter time, still devoutly revolutionary, true, but a time of poets, intellectuals and politicians. Not of militarists, opportunists and warlords. Within the nation, there remains those who manage to straddle the line between both worlds. A thinker, whilst also a tactician. A writer, and a warrior. Counted amongst these is that of Cheng Qian, as although he has been a military man all throughout his life, he associates himself with innumerous intellectual thinkers, and has compiled quite an amassment of poetry and prose.\n\nAfter visiting the Yueyang Tower, the General took time to reflect. On the battle he fought here, notably against Wu Peifu, in 1917. On the similar resemblance of the scenery, after returning home from both war and exile. With a melancholic flair, the General begun drafting a new piece:\n\n\"What is the thing that the country treasures the most? There is no trace of the old forts from back in those days.\nStrive to overlook yet the scene is depressing, there is a long way ahead and the snowstorm is raging.\nA small island in the sea is cherished by the birds, but the boats and ships still want to clash with the waves.\nThroughout the ages melancholy is congested, countless graces and grudges confronted with each other.\nThe Jiuyi Mountains and Mount Heng seem within reach, yet still the Hells remain an obstacle.\"\n\nConsidering the continued struggle against warlords, against his own party, against those who distil the revolution, it would appear that the history of this nation is smothered with bloodshed and suffering. Yet even then, the fight must continue, despite the odds. Under siege on all fronts, he shall not let Hunan's revolution falter, ever preserving it."
 hnn.kmt.19.a: "This is our burden to bear."
 hnn.kmt.19.b: "A wasteful time for poetry, no?"
  
 #Zhao Hengti Events 
  
 hnn.fed.1.t: "The Democratic Mandate!"
 hnn.fed.1.d_1: "With Zhao's coalition and the Kuomintang seemingly in a deadlock in the Assembly, a number of political independents formed the kingmaker in deciding who was Governor. Fearing that they'd be sidelined if the Kuomintang won, they threw their votes behind Zhao, and ensured the Governorship for him. In his acceptance speech, Zhao has spoken about keeping Hunan safe in the turbulent times ahead, and that he would do all he can to strengthen and reinforce their young democracy, alongside thanking everybody who helped him during this election season, and promised to ensure a free and fair Hunan for all of it's citizens, regardless of their background."
 hnn.fed.1.d_2: "Zhao Hengti's coalition has won the election by a notable margin. This result hardly comes as a surprise, given he was the favourite going in.

 hnn.fed.1.a: "To Hunan and to Democracy!"
  
 hnn.fed.2.t: "The Lines in the Sand"
 hnn.fed.2.d: "Governor Zhao may have won the election, but that does not mean Hunan's democracy is secured. In fact, between the surprise success of the Kuomintang and the Assembly members elected under warlord influences (Tang Xiangming, Chen Quzhen, and Tian Yingzhao) it seems like this election has served to give more authoritarian figures a stronger hand.\n\nThese forces, while not allies in any capacity, all collectively serve as a threat to our young democracy, if the Kuomintang grows too strong we could easily see Tang Xiangming march south on us, and decapitate our democracy at the head. Furthermore, the Xiangxi Diarchy has grown more and more distant from us, aligning itself with Tang Xiangming more as time goes on. They may be biding their time right now, but that will not last forever, and we must act before they do.\n\nLuckily, we aren't alone in our fight. Governor Zhao quickly recognised the threat and has acted accordingly, forming a \"Grand Coalition\" with the other democratic parties (and independents) in order to form a broad democratic front. With the Grand Coalition formed, we have access to several tools to undercut the authoritarians in our province, and hamstring their efforts to kill the democracy so dear to our Governor."

 hnn.fed.3.d.assassinated: "In a most heinous act, the warlord of Guangxi, Ma Ji, successfully ordered the assassination of our ally Chen Jiongming, the leader of China's Federalists and Liangguang. Chen had been tricked to attend the funeral of Ma Ji's predecessor and adopted father in Nanning, Guangxi, where he was gunned down in an ambush.\n\nWith the government of Liangguang and Guangdong in shambles along with the Federalist movement, our alliance with them has become null and void as they descend into civil war between bickering provincial leaders."
 hnn.fed.3.d.coup: "Seeing an opportunity to seize power for himself, the KMT-aligned politician and general Chen Mingshu led a coup against our ally Chen Jiongming in Guangzhou. Chen Jiongming's fate is currently unknown, but the rumour mill in the city appears convinced that he is still alive and has fled to Hong Kong.\n\nWhile this appears to be preventing a war between Liangguang's two provinces as Guangxi was recently seized by Li Zongren, another KMT-aligned warlord, our alliance with Liangguang has been rendered null and void with our ally's illegal removal from power."
 hnn.fed.3.d.defeat: "As the dust settled between the Old and New Guangxi cliques, the victor turned his gaze towards Guangdong, pulling Liangguang into a bloody civil war. In a most grave development, the Federalist forces lost the conflict, Chen Jiongming's fate being unknown. With Liangguang now being ruled by Governor [GXC.GetLeader], we can no longer count Liangguang among our allies, and our alliance is rendered null and void."

With bad blood between the two men running deep, ever since Tang arrested Zhao and threw him in a Beijing prison on Yuan Shikai's orders, Zhao has never held the man in a good light, despite both having Zhili sympathies.\n\nThe Governor has just given the order to the commander of Hunan's 1st Division, He Yaozu, to take his army to Yueyang and formally arrest Tang. Only a few hours after the order was given He Yaozu was outside the city, when Tang Xiangming's garrison came out and skirmished against He's forces. Ultimately Tang was outmatched, and retreated across the border. While this sadly means Zhao was unable to arrest Tang, it does mean that he can no longer pose a threat to our democracy."

 hnn.fed.4.a: "Good riddance."
  
 hnn.fed.5.t: "Our Administration and our Intelligentsia"
 hnn.fed.5.d: "One of the pillars of our support is Hunan's intelligentsia. Ever since the repression of intellectuals by the League many of China's intellectuals have fled to Hunan for safety, and Governor Zhao has been happy to host them. Our Government and our intelligentsia form a symbiotic relationship, and they were a vital piece to our reelection, and as such Zhao has bolstered his support even further than before. These efforts have turned Changsha into a intellectual hub, a place for the brightest minds of China to meet and speak on matters plaguing the nation.\n\nThis, quite naturally, reflects well on our own administration and shows that intellectual debate, that democracy, is certainly possible, even with the troubles of warlords and banditry. An impressive feat for a Province that, only a few years ago, was trapped inside the same League that repressed these bright minds, and stifled learning in the country as a whole."
 hnn.fed.5.a: "To a renewed partnership!"
  
 hnn.fed.6.t: "Troubles with Monroe"
 hnn.fed.6.d: "One of the more peculiar parts of Hunan's Constitution is that of Article 89, otherwise known as the \"Monroe Doctrine\", which states that no other Provinces troops may enter Hunan, and Hunanese troops may not leave the Province. While this has been intended to keep Hunan safe from Armies during the tumultuous time of the warlord era, it has become a detriment to Hunan's safety. The warlords and provincial leaders outside of Hunan hardly care about what our Constitution states, and as such it fails to offer a real defence against them, only serving to bind our ability to act in favour of Hunan.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind, Zhao has pushed for the Monroe Doctrine to be amended, to allow Hunan's armies to march out of the province, and for the central government to move through Hunan when necessary. Defending his amendments in the Provincial Assembly he has pointed towards the Northern Expedition, the League Collapse, the two times the Kuomintang forcefully marched their troops into Hunan. Stating that the Monroe Doctrine did nothing to stop them, and that they didn't hesitate for a second because of it.\n\nTo his surprise, the Assembly was shockingly receptive to this argument, it seems the two Kuomintang armies marching into Hunan had served as a wake up call to many in the Assembly, realising that the only way for Hunan to truly be safe from warlords and enemy armies, is for China to be united under one banner."
 hnn.fed.6.a: "For a new Hunan in a new China!"
  
 hnn.fed.7.t: "An Olive Branch for Labour"
 hnn.fed.7.d: "Our relationship with organised labour has been... fraught, to say the least. With the unfortunate deaths of labour activists during Zhao's administration in the past being emblematic of those difficult relationships. But Governor Zhao is determined to change this. Organised labour is a pillar of the Kuomintang's support and if he is to undercut the self proclaimed \"Party-State\" and secure Hunanese Democracy, he must forge a peace with labour.\n\nMeeting with major labour leaders in Changde, the tension in the air was palpable. After introductions were made Zhao explained that, despite actions in the past, he wished to offer an olive branch to labour. Seizing the opportunity, the labour leaders immediately made a series of demands, functionally asking for a new law that would bolster labour unions and improve their ability to barter on the behalf of workers.\n\nGovernor Zhao recognised their initial demands wouldn't pass through the Assembly, and after a series of tense negotiations he managed to talk them down to a compromise bill, one that he was certain he could force through the Assembly. With this agreement made, pending the bill being made into law of course, it seemed like he could finally call a truce with organised labour, and cut support for the Kuomintang in Hunan's major cities."
 hnn.fed.7.a: "The first step to harmony with labour."
  
 hnn.fed.8.t: "Our Own Bill of Rights"
 hnn.fed.8.d: "Hunan's Provincial Constitution already confers a number of rights to it's citizens. Including Habeas Corpus (Article 6), the right to own private property (Article 7), the freedom of religion (Article 10), freedom of association (Article 12), the right to bear arms (Article 13), and compulsory universal education (Article 21). These are major advancements to our cause, but we must work to reinforce these rights and add more, including a right to free speech, right to criticise the Government, and freedom of the press. While all three are de facto rights under Zhao's administration, we cannot ensure others will follow the Governor's precedent.\n\nAs such, Governor Zhao met with many of the brightest minds in Hunan, gathering a collection of intellectuals, and hosted a conference to give Hunan it's own Bill of Rights, further codifying the current protections in the Constitution, and reinforcing them with the new rights stated above.\n\nAfter a long debate among the different intellectuals, the conference has proved a resounding success, and Zhao has used his own personal clout and political acumen to push it through the Assembly, allowing to pass the vote in its pure form, and ensuring more rights for every citizen of our province!"
 hnn.fed.8.a: "An important step for freedom."
  
 hnn.fed.9.t: "Old Allies, New Problems"
 hnn.fed.9.d: "The Xiangxi Diarchy in the west has generally been aligned with Governor Zhao's clique. Despite this, they serve as an obstacle to the burgeoning Hunanese democracy. Working within his powers as Governor, Zhao has made several reforms in the west, curtailing Tian Yingzhao's official positions in terms of power, and using his forces to ensure the western villages local representatives are those who will properly represent their villages, rather than serving the interests of the Diarchy\n\nThese reforms aren't without their opponents, the Diarchy controls a notable amount of seats in the Assembly, who made their best attempts to block the reforms on the Assembly floor.\n\nSupport against them came from, much to our own surprise, many of the Assemblymen voted on the Kuomintang ticket, seemingly finding the Western Diarchy, a pair of warlords, as more intolerable than Governor Zhao is. Chief among these members was former Governor Tan Yankai, who gave an impassioned speech in favour of the reforms. We know not what his intentions were behind this, nor what benefit it will provide to him, but we are certainly grateful for his assistance in removing warlord influence in Hunan."
 hnn.fed.9.a: "An allied warlord is still a warlord."
  
 hnn.fed.10.t: "The Federalist Model Province"
 hnn.fed.10.d: "After fighting fierce resistance and enemies on all sides, Governor Zhao has successfully defended and reinforced Hunan's democracy from those who would rather see it destroyed. Between Tang Xiangming and the Kuomintang, balancing on the razor thin wire was a difficult endeavour, but being the expert political operator he is, Zhao managed to thread the needle. Curbing the influence of the Kuomintang through appeals to the peasant and worker, ensuring they couldn't use populist unrest as the sword against Hunan's young democracy. On the other side, Tang Xiangming and his Yueyang garrison has been expelled from Hunan, and the Sword of Damocles that hung over Hunan's democracy has been shattered. While there is still room for further work, Governor Zhao's efforts have led to a wonderful expansion of the people's rights, of democratic traditions, and of local democracy in China. A model for all Federalists to follow, Hunan has solidified itself as a Democratic Stronghold in the heart of China."
 hnn.fed.10.a: "To Hunan, to the Constitution, and to a Federal China!"
  
 hnn.fed.11.t: "Constitution Day"
 hnn.fed.11.d: "Today is the anniversary of the restoration of the Hunan constitution, one of the few holiday's wholly unique to the Hunan Province. Celebrations are being held in every major city, with Governor Zhao giving a speech in front of the Governor's Office, stating how honoured he is to lead one of the truly democratic provinces in China. After his speech he joined with a parade going through Changsha, celebrating the anniversary of the Constitution and of the democratic flame in Hunan. The energy in the air was palpable, the hard work Governor Zhao has put in being clear just walked down the street, a bright spot in the darkness of the warlord era, Hunan is truly an example for all to follow!"

 HNN.economy.1.d: "Having been one of the composite provinces of the League of Eight Provinces, naturally the Hunanese economy was reasonably integrated into the broader German current. However, being majority agrarian. and surrounded by the industrial cities on the hill of Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Nanjing, the Hunanese economic sectors have had a troubled experience during the Warlord Era. For who in their right mind would seek to invest in Hunan, when the grass is greener not too far away.\n\nNot is all lost though, for maintaining our autonomy from Sun Chuanfang has been to our benefit in more ways than one. As despite the rather paltry economic conditions following what has been dubbed \"Black Monday\", Hunan has fared slightly better than its neighbours in the League, or the Central Government.\n\nYet with our main economic partners undergoing worse turmoil, our agricultural sector is witnessing calamitous effects as a result, and our investors are rapidly fleeing.

For over a decade, Hunan has seen its industrial heartland rot and decay due to mismanagement, war, repression, and chaos. Hunan's industrialists flee for brighter pastures, its workers stuck to their chains, a community of nepotism and incompetence has developed within its core.\n\nThis stagnant state of affairs has only been a detriment to the province's attempts to prosper. Yet not all is poor, for Hunan's urban worker population remains steadfast and dedicated to their roles in the workforce, and they are moderately trained in technical skills. Alongside this, Hunan is a province rich with agricultural and mineral resources, that only need a concerted effort to capitalise on. Even further, Hunan's connection to the Guangzhou-Beijing railway lends it an excellent bridging point to expand to other markets within the nation, and outside.\n\nSplit between two camps, Governor [HNN.GetLeader] is left with a considerable decision to deliberate. His leftist coalition partners are urging the Governor to focus on an insular, autarkic approach, so that the province's workers may prosper under state guidance. On the other hand, his own party rally against such attempts of central nationalisation, considering it to be no better than socialism from the onset. Instead, they propose that Hunan merely needs to embrace the benefits brought forth by foreign capital and investors, for such avenues can grant Hunan considerable growth, and overcome any consequences that may arise in the future. Weighing his choices, the Governor has but only to make the final decision."

The New Armies, as they were otherwise known, fragmented into cliques, split upon provincial alignments. Even today some remain dominant, with the greatest of them being the Zhili clique, as under the wise guidance of the Jade Marshal, they managed to unite the core of the nation following its disastrous split.\n\nWith the nation once again split into factional infighting, those who will see it to a proper unification necessitate superior arms, and superior officers, if they are to overcome the myriad of obstacles that are situated between them and a strong China. Fully understanding this concept, the watchful guidance of Governor [HNN.GetLeader] has led to thorough and extensive military reforms, stylised upon the victorious German Eagle.\n\nOwing his loyalties to the Zhili Clique, and before that, Yuan Shikai, the Governor has taken up the mantle of crafting the true representation of the New Armies. Elite officers, drilled soldiers, and superior generals, may all those who oppose the Zhili test their might against Hunan's New Model Army, and see the folly of their actions."
 HNN.military.1.d_fed: "Not known for their military accomplishments, few would have expected that the most premier fighting force within the nation would be [HNN.GetLeader]'s Xiang Army. With middling success in the 1920s, having been ousted numerous times by the perfidious Kuomintang, Zhao's fighting force was deemed to be that of a spent one, having to rely on the benevolence of Wu Peifu in order to see his restoration to the Governorship of Hunan. However, the sheer determined mindset of Zhao and his army has led to the stability that Hunan so desperately desired.\n\nWith the nation once again split into factional infighting, those who will see it to a proper unification necessitate superior arms, and superior officers, if they are to overcome the myriad of obstacles that are situated between them and a strong China. Fully acknowledging his past experiences, and the limits of the province, [HNN.GetLeader] has embarked on a series of extensive and thorough reforms, stylised upon the victorious German Eagle.\n\nWhilst a Federalist through and through, Zhao's forces are thoroughly independent of the Yue Army under Chen Jiongming, or the Yunnanese Army of Tang Jiyao. Instead, his force is uniquely that of a Hunanese one. For without German, or Federalist support, Zhao has managed to craft an army of elite officers, drilled soldiers and superior generals compared to all of his contemporaries. The road to national unification may be long, but the Hunanese army will ensure that the dreams of the Federalist movement come to fruition."

Yet it is not just our soldiers that exceed expectations, but our officers, our commanding staff, that have truly flourished under the reforms.\n\nNot a Hunan native by birth, [HNN.GetLeader] has found himself time and time again within the province, leading armies, directing bureaucrats, and even has two tenures as Governor under his belt. Truthfully however, he has always been a man for the sea. Starting out his military career as an admiral in the late Qing Dynasty, Tang would only come to lead armies following the outbreak of the National Protection War in 1916, wherein he was governor of Hunan at the time. Having been granted general status in 1917, Tang would continue to lead armies well into the 1920s, carrying an air of professionalism associated with the navy.\n\nUnder his second tenure as governor, Hunan's army has undergone radically monumental reforms building it up from a disparate, shell of its former glories to the true warriors of China. Whilst not commanding fleets as he preferably would, he has managed to find a new home in his New Army."

From his own local forces, to those of the Western and Eastern Hunan warlords, none can compare to the might of its armies in the present. For Zhao however, this is more than a flourish of his government, or his people, but a sign of his true commitment to seeing his revolution through.\n\nA member of the older revolutionary generation, having graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy with the likes of Tang Jiyao, Yan Xishan, Cheng Qian and Li Liejun, Zhao is an old tiger that has seen a lot of bloodshed. Serving under Cai E, commanding the likes of Bai Chongxi and Huang Shaohong, a subordinate of Tan Yankai, friend of Wu Peifu.

Freely able to communicate between lower and higher ranks, the men would discuss and criticise the conduct of individual officers and soldiers, alongside the battle or campaign plans. With this, the presiding commander over the meeting would then conclude by asking questions about future planned engagements for the unit.\n\nWith all commanders addressing the mass meetings in person, they would hope to convey the broader political and military situation to the soldiers and officers, with the aim of reinforcing their understanding of why they fight, and what for. Promoted by He and Peng as maintaining equalisation of information amongst its leaders, it is hoped that such a novel initiative will be utilised to remove incompetent commanders, and maintain a meritocratic system.

Yet they continue to risk their lives, reaching above and beyond mission objectives, for they truly understand that whilst everyone dies, the lives of them and their comrades live on within every Chinese Revolutionary.

In what has been deemed a surprise by many within the Central Committee, Tang Shengzhi and the 8th Army's decision to uproot themselves from the fighting within the League War, and enter into the Hunan Provincial election, has resulted in his seemingly resolute victory. Whilst uncertain in initial prospects, the entrance of our estranged comrade Cheng Qian into the election perhaps transformed their combined efforts.\n\nWith a combined Kuomintang ticket, the rightist Cheng Qian and leftist Tang Shengzhi came together to subvert Zhao Hengti's election victory, and through Hunan's legislature election process held shortly after their announced victory, it was decided that Tang Shengzhi would win the governorship, with Cheng Qian maintaining an important position within the Provincial Government.\n\nAligned more with his fellow leftists, [CHI.GetLeader] has thoroughly congratulated the new official Kuomintang Governor, securing the Party's hold within the nation."

Whilst not a surprise to the Central Committee, many are still inflamed that the despot retains his stranglehold on the province. More importantly, it would appear that the rogue General Tang Shengzhi, alongside the 8th Army, have fled from Hunan, recently entering [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nExpressing his sincere apologies for his abrupt departure, the General has begged [CHI.GetLeader] for forgiveness, and offered to fight for the National Revolutionary Army once more. Nominally aligned with the Provisional Action Committee, this may be a chance for [CHI.GetLeader] to remove a potential political foe, however Tang and his subordinates are incredibly talented on the field, and it could still provide a net benefit."

Camped out in the split province of Guizhou, the Right Kuomintang remnant allowed head of the 6th Army, Cheng Qian, to place himself within the race.\n\nWith such a bold move, the General negotiated a joint Kuomintang ticket with Tang Shengzhi, and through their joint efforts, managed to clinch electoral victory. Following in the aftermath, it was decided that Cheng Qian would secure the Governorship, whilst Tang Shengzhi would retain a critical position within the Government.\n\nIn a dramatic upset, radicals within the party are decrying betrayal at Tang's alignment with the Right wing of our party, others however, notably those within the Provisional Action Committee, maintain the concept that this was a beautiful victory, and that a key ally has been secured."

Even more absurd, the General apparently did so at the same time as the Left Kuomintang's very own Tang Shengzhi, who crossed into Eastern Hunan from the Insurgency Zone.\n\nIn a futile attempt to depose Zhao Hengti, the two generals collaborated in a joint Kuomintang unity ticket, however it was doomed from the very start. Using his masterful, and sincere, command of Hunan's political sphere, Zhao very easily defeated the Kuomintang's efforts.\n\nAs swift as their union was, Cheng and Tang divorced their companionship, going their separate ways. Such events lead up to the present, where the tarnished General has returned to Kunming, offering his services to [YUN.GetLeader].

Seeing his beloved province and constitution be tarnished by what he perceives as autocrats, the ex-Governor was left with no choice.\n\nPacking up his belongings, and arranging contact with his devout allies Ye Kaixin and He Yaozu, the trio have reportedly fled to whatever government may take them.

Yet, in a climactic surprise, the crafty General secured an alliance with Right Kuomintang leader and commander of the 6th Army Cheng Qian, who had also entered the province at roughly the same time.\n\nFollowing a joint Kuomintang unity campaign against Zhao and other lesser parties, the duo managed to secure a staunch victory, yet it was not destined to be that way. The Yueyang Garrison, the Zhili's vice-grip on Hunan's neck, was inclined to act in a desperate bid to secure Hunan for the Zhili once more, and whilst a brave attempt, the spent forces of the 8th and 6th armies stood no chance against the Zhili onslaught. With their defeat, Yueyang Commander Tang Xiangming declared martial law, the constitution as null, and himself as Governor, to restore order.\n\nFleeing terrible persecution, the party has entered into a fierce debate as to whether they should accept the joint forces of Tang and Cheng, however through the personal intervention of Li Jishen, the two men have been granted their commission unequivocally as a sign of goodwill, much to the anger of [CHI.GetLeader]."

Yet, all was not well for Hunan, as despite Zhao's tenure for over a decade, he still had to contend with the Zhili influences within his province. To the east in Guizhou, the likes of Yuan Zuming, with his connections to the Young China Party. To the west, the Hunan Diarchy, under the rule of despots Chen Quzhen and Tian Yingzhao, who have long entrenched their position. Most critically, to the north, was Tang Xiangming, ruling Yueyang as his own personal fiefdom.\n\nUnfortunately for us, it would appear that Zhao could not manage to maintain the control of stability within his province, and as a result Tang Xiangming was spurned to march towards the capital of Changsha, and oust the incumbent Governor in the name of squashing the chaos and incompetence that was plaguing Hunan's administration. With such an act, Tang has opted to cut all previous diplomatic ties with Zhao's allies, including [FROM.GetLeader], and has opted to reorient the province towards his Zhili overlords."

And yet one would not think [HNN.GetLeader] to have been so devout in the revolutionary mission. Originally joining the Tongmenghui under the influence of Tan Renfeng, [HNN.GetLeader] would serve in the Xinhai Revolution, but that would be where his revolutionary fervour would subside. Yet again picking up the torch in 1926, his true flame would transform into an inferno, with his 8th Army being the tool by which he would burn it all down.\n\nDespite being a critical member in the formation of the MinGan Insurgency Zone, and associated with the Left-wing of the Party, Tang has found himself a radical amongst moderates and autocrats. Despite pressure from below, namely the Radicals, and from above, Tang stands strong, steadfast and resilient, entrenching Hunan's position within the nation as a hotbed of socialist thought. Now that a time of national rebuilding is upon us, the Left Kuomintang may no longer be the dominant faction, but they're not finished as long as the \"Buddhist\" General rules his province."
